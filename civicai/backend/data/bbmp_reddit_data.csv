reddit,2016-09-27 10:49:12,"why is there is no movement or activism in india to simplify government routine processes? i don't want flair this as a political post but there should be certainly no need to complicate or elongate certain routine government services such as getting death certificates, getting residency certificates, getting passport verification, plan approvals, etc.

like many of you, i have suffered first hand harassment at bbmp office (bangalore) to get my dad's death certificate. the form was solely in kannada (i am a kannadiga and yet found it very difficult to understand certain precise words) and most of the form was unreadable.(why is there no english version?)  to make it worse, i had to roam to this office 3-4 times before i gave up and bribed a middleman to get it for me. why is it so complicated to get a death certificate?(isn't loss of a family member enough suffering?) it should be a simple form online with multi-language translations to get this certificate.  

i believe corruption originates from bureaucracy and complicated processes. make the process simple and see how efficient it is to conduct affairs and see drastic drop in corruption/touting. provide a realistic deadline on when latest by which our requests will be processed. train govt employees to be people friendly and instill values. it is high time government processes are simplified and made more efficient. it is plain stupid to wake up one-day and claim we have to stop corruption without easing processes.

thoughts?"
reddit,2016-11-23 19:49:55,"are there any immediate consequences or charges made by police for trespassing in someones property as a mob, intimidation etc? i read in a facebook post where:

1) a bunch of people(residents) targeted a small family by falsely claiming they have built their property compound on road.

2) barged into the property of this family with about 60 people.

3) the distressed family pleaded them to go settle the matter with bbmp(even though the compound was already inspected by bbmp and confirmed it was not built on the road).

4) after pleading them to go to bbmp, the family tried to close the house door and the mob pushed back the door and started taking pictures and saying the family will be ridiculed on facebook and other social media.

5) an elderly was said to be so concerned and anxious of her family that she was trembling and had to be calmed down in another room.

i think if the family complains(which i'm sure they will), the police will just give a warning to these unruly people?"

we pay so  much money as tax, be it on automobles, petrol, cigarettes, liquor, income tax, tax on electronics like laptops, mobile phones, toll on highways

bhenchod why the fuck are you even collecting taxes from me if you are going to come begging again during time of crisis. 

its not that they are providing pothole free roads, swift public transport, education or healthcare for that tax. fine - don't provide all these basic services but at least the government should not come with a begging bowl during each crisis!

the fuck does my tax money go apart from paying salaires of inefficient incompetent underqualified government employees who underperform because the have job security?"

went to an eye hosp in bellandur too that was listedin the bbmp website. gave there too but later was told they are doing eye surgeries and not all workers have masks but they are currently not looking after covid patients.

went to st john's to but there they already had good ppe, so did not give. will visit government hospital close by when i can get permission. after lock down will visit other places.

i wore an n95 and stayed at each place for less than 30 seconds as i read more the interaction higher the chances of catching. today lock down here, have a few masks but wont venture out till i get permission."

reddit,2020-08-16 22:14:28,"india's transport safety is a farce having big fines won't fix the problems. {bit long but don't skip} *i will tell you why i am writing this at the end of the post,*

&amp;#x200b;

# our transport safety guidelines are very backdated and so is the training given to drivers.

* the crash tests done are only frontal and apply to vehicles sold  from june 2019  passenger vehicles only no such tests for heavy vehicles, busses, smaller vehicles like commercial vans  autos, bikes                      which means a huge chunk of cars which run on our roads were never tested for safety including most vehicles sold before 2019 

i would commend global ncap for at least testing vehicles sold in india but even their testing is just for the frontal collisions only 

no tests are done for side collisions(the second biggest cause of death in a crash ), rear-end collisions or rollover crashes   

to put it simply a car can get good scores in global ncap testing but get very poor scores in euroncap *or like this global ncap is class 10 maths and euroncap is class 12 maths* 

also, the lack of safety equipment required in india is a big differentiator among the chances of surviving the crash or getting into one in the first place.

cars need one driver airbag only in india to be approved for sale, these were the requirements for the first-ever euroncap way back in 1997  &amp;  1979, nhtsa  (usa)

no crash-avoidance tech needed

no need to have automatic speed-sensitive braking which prevents head-on collision by braking the car itself at lower speeds 

blind-spot monitoring 

emergency alert for when the vehicle senses a crash an alert is sent to the emergency department 

shock absorbing  body frame (crump\[le zones ) 

usability of the vehicle after a crash is  also tested in euroncap which means is the vehicle unable after repairs or not and how much strength will the body have 

# lack of any periodic fitness tests 

it is a common sight to see people doing makeshift repairs to vehicles and running without working equipment in many parts of india 

nonworking brakes

 weakened chassis which may snap in case of stress

 running on really old worn out  tires, which can burst anytime 

handling issues like not able to turn or maneuver the vehicle due to broken steering 

sharp objects that can cause cuts to passengers or impale pedestrians, other vehicles like rods or bumper guards which are rigid 

a regular test is done by government authority about the safety of vehicles to prove its roadworthiness like the yearly mot done in the uk

this could be a good revenue-generating opportunity for the transport department these tests prevent vehicle failure while they are on roads and removing vehicles who are unfit for road use

as people are always being stingy with the upkeep of their vehicles usually commercial ones even more as they have to reduce cost busses are known to puncture a tire and skid on the road or brake fade 

# proper training for a license

 most tests in india are just driving in a closed path and parking the vehicle and that's it you get your license 

we are not taught how to:-

 change lanes 

overtake properly 

give way to an emergency vehicle like an ambulance 

use of high beams 

turning  on an unsigned crossing 

stopping in case of emergency 

instead of having those rudimentary tests that don't check for real-life situations simulators is an option most are not so expensive now and provide a very comparable experience for training

 even if having just informational videos in regional languages before getting the test could help 

eg:- while i was learning to drive a rickshaw driver was also learning to drive a truck he was illiterate and had a lot of difficulty explaining him the rules he didn't make it the first time after that he paid a bribe to pass the mcq test according to my driving instructor he said ""he wouldn't pass and every time he doesn't it costs him 500₹ so it's better he just gets the mcqs done ""

and i mean videos not just books or sheets department of parivahan can do it 

&amp;#x200b;

# infrastructure is subpar in many places 

if you leave out some special zones in cities most of our roads have these issues 

accident prone zone 

blind corners 

lack of parking forcing people to park on streets 

pothole-ridden roads we all know how they can cause bikers to fall and be hit fro ma a fast-moving vehicle from the behind 

our crash barriers are rigid which tear the vehicle instead of absorbing the force of the impact of the vehicle while other places have been using collapsible barriers lamp posts and signboard 

when some construction is done there are no safety barriers with lights just barriers and with illumination not present everywhere

busses and trucks dominate the roads they take 

overloading the vehicles 

carrying larger sized loads and not having load properly tied down 

usually, construction material carrying vehicles have their cargo dangerously packed which can impale people from the behind a rod could be sticking out of the vehicle in many cases another is bricks or stone carrying trucks never seem to tie them with a plastic sheet and in case of heavy braking a brick could easily  fall off the vehicle and smash the windshield of any vehicle that is close to the truck

&amp;#x200b;

# bikes &amp; scooters 

bikes and scooters make up a majority of the vehicles on our road and most accidents with these   easy to crash  2 wheelers result in fatalities 

bikes should have leg protection guard mandatory and abs without abs bikes are very easy to skid 

also, bikers tend to go into blind spots of bigger vehicles easily honking doesn't work every time 

people remove rearview mirrors on bikes for looks 

going into every small gap not giving any signals  before changing lanes 

tripling on a bike is common everyone has done it a few times in their life

# vlogging while driving 

these days everyone is a youtuber it seems people carry a camera while driving it is very distracting in my opinion and may increase response time  as one hand is busy holding  a camera and people are talking as well too many things to do while driving 

# use of dash cameras 

dash cams are very helpful in finding  who was the culprit and can be used as legal evidence as well 

but they are not mandatory 

# fatigue 

driving is a  tiring job and driving for long periods of time is not good  as we tend to get slowed reflexes  and poor decision making 

truckers are not required to stop after driving for 12hrs as they are in many countries 

# our culture of cars is  about show off 

people like to do stunts 

going  fast and record it most vloggers say don't repeat but the hypocrisy is they keep uploading content of the fast speed and stunts and they have to in order to make money

people race from one red stop to other thinking it is cool risking them and others lives 

showing off whose car has more bling bigger speakers no one considers even buying safer vehicles 

48% of all cars are sold by one country maruti whose safety record is quite low maruti and renault datsun make very unsafe  cars 

motorsport in can be done in  india 

 because of the hi-entry cost few people can do it in a safe manner instead of  having tracks where people can drive in a controlled environment  where they are less likely to injure themselves or someone else we don't have such things over here

there are a few tracks but people seldom use them or  even know about them

# reasons why 

it is not that india is a small vehicle market we are always in the top 5 for the past few years every other country of this size of the market has stricter laws even rusting warranty is provided 

india was a dumping ground for most brands to sell their products which were not allowed to be sold in developed countries  

tata and mahindra have been selling vehicles in australia with all the safety features that are needed 

the cost doesn't go extremely high but a bit more yes 

we are very easily satisfied people and quite gullible as well

what  the bjp government has done are baby steps while we need strides 

we should ask for better systems

if  we don't ask for the thing the government would never deliver  

if anyone knows a way through which i can maybe make my words heard to someone who has some authority or capability it would be much appreciated  

**a few days ago i was speaking to someone who travels in some countries he said he has driven vehicles in europe and some countries in asia when i asked him about india he said ""hell no"" stating that we take safety too low and we trust on gods for our safety** 

**this made me a bit angry so i started pointing at him how we have made strides of progress in the past few years and how he was wrong about the most accidents happening in india that  accidents per 100,000 residents is much lower in india when compared to neighboring countries, saying that only busses in winter get into an accident a few days after this a relative of mine was hit by a lorry it was night time and so due to lack of visibility he crossed the road and the truck just hit him he died there he was 2-3 years older than me i feel bad all the shit talk i did and it's not the first time a couple of seniors and friends had been injured in accidents a few scuffs may be a bruises a one senior who was racing on the road in his sx4 no airbags was someone who died a2-3yrs ago while racing on the streets but that didn't affect me as this accident did he was not racing nor doing stunts also now i feel bad for the people  who lost somone they knew due to someone elses faults i now feel afraid  driving as some bbc show put it the most dangerous thing you can do drive on a highway in india at night** 

 we all know someone who died in a crash or see clips or in the paper, but in fact, india and china account for almost half of the fatalities around the globe india exceeding a little bit the facts don't lie we have the second biggest population but to become a superpower we should have would class transport system

please upvote if you agree show that more people can we see this post and take away something or suggest me something i might not know about

there was a video of an indian girl getting her head run over by a crane after losing balance and falling off her scooty due to a pothole on liveleak and foreigners were commenting that the male bystanders looked disappointed with the crushed head since they won't be able to get a forced blowjob from the girl anymore. and that many male bystanders looked like they could rape the corpse as well. 

this is what foreigners think about us. 

now some fake nationalist will show up and say that i want white man's validation. shame on that so called nationalist. 

it's not about bloody validation. it's about self respect and honor. don't these people who accuse others of seeking white man's validation feel ashamed at all when indians get stereotyped as pervy rapists? 

lastly, all indian cops and civil servants, bureaucrats, ias officers should be ashamed of themselves. obviously they were stopping media from reaching family members of the girl because after hearing the family strong sentiments would have gotten evoked. also i can't believe that they were doing that on their own by themselves. repeatedly cops were parroting the same thing only. that they ""were just following orders from their superiors"", in front of the media. obviously it has to be the yogi led government only that was giving all the orders.

now, i don't believe for even a second that its not possible to build long-lasting roads which can endure rains for many years. consider that the british built the howrah bridge way back in early 1900s and it still stands tall today without any single contractor getting his hafta? we are always vocal about trivial issues like drugs and bollywood and inter-faith adverts but why not raise issue on important topics like this (corruption in construction industry) which effects a common indian like you and me? that's a question i want to ask."

so i've seen a lot of tenants rant here, on how landlords are annoying. here's a different perspective just so you guys understand why we do what we do. i'm a student and i've seen my father go through hell while dealing with tenants throughout my childhood. most of them are terrible. we've had people move in while promising to give the advance later and never doing it. they leave overnight and we're left with 2-3 months of rent left to recover. they make us wait months before giving us the rent. sometimes, we never recover it at all. we have to call them a million times and yell at them into giving what is ours. there have been instances where they don't even recieve our calls.

they don't pay the electricity bills and the power gets cut. we never get to know because we don't live there. we have to pay extra to get the connection back on top of which we have to pay their bills as well. 

there is currently this woman who is putting us through hell. she moved in with her husband and he passed away shortly after. they never gave us the advance (because their gpay transaction ""failed"") or the rent. we didn't preassurize them to pay rent, knowing that the husband was in hospital. as soon as her husband passed way, she locked the house with all their belongings inside and went to stay with her parents. we gave her a month after her husband passed away and did not ask for rent (by which time the rent we were to receive had accumulated to that of about 4 months). after this, we called her asking when she could pay and she said she'd come by and pay in about 3-4 days. now this was about a month ago. everytime we call her, she speaks like she's sleppy and never answers questions. she's even stopped picking her phone up at this point. we were nice initially but she simply doesn't keep her promise. she couldn't told us she's having a rough time and that she'll pay at a later date and we would've accepted this. she could've done this and taken her belongings out of the house so we could at least rent it out to someone else. we too have financial commitments. she says she'll give the rent but never does. she has locked the house up, which we can't break into without having filed an fir. her brother even called my father up and said, ""onti hensu anta eneno heltidyante"" (translation: ""apparently you're saying things because she's a single woman""). now my father has recorded every conversation he's had with her boy we're still afraid she might file fake cases using the fact that she's a woman to her advantage. she has nothing on us but it's still a lot of time and effort wasted. we can't rent this house out until she takes away all her belongings and that's good money wasted again. 

this is one of at least 10-12 troublesome tenants we've had out of about 20 we have so far hosted. point being, things like these go both ways. there are terrible tenants and equally terrible landlords. it so happens that most people in general are terrible human beings. next time you rent a place, be nice to the landlord, you might be surprised at how easily all the ""rules"" vanish (at least with the nice landlords). they are in place to protect ourselves from assholes like these not to harass tenants. 

our other tenants, at the house where we live, are really nice people. we let them pay rent late when they're having issues (which they usually pay on time anyway). we divide water bill equally although they have 1 extra person in the family and they use way more water anyway. we allow them to make use of spaces that they're not entitled to just because they ask nicely. we even charge them significantly less rent (about 1-2k) compared to other houses in the area and rarely hike it (they've stayed here for 8 years). all these perks come automatically when you're a nice tenant. 

if you're a landlord reading this, give every new tenant the benifit of the doubt, there are really nice ones out there (why does this sound like relationship advice). stop harassing new tenants assuming they're all the same. 

conclusion? there are assholes and nice people everywhere, be the nice ones.

edit: i think this wasn't clear. we've never been cheated entirely in earlier cases. the small amounts of deposits (the half or so that they did pay) covered for the rent money they defaulted on and we recovered the same. this was the case with 2 or something earlier tenants. we've never given anyone the keys without the deposit except these few cases (of which only 1 of them didn't post us any deposit).  the rest were defaulters on rent payment that we got evicted after 3 months and recovered the due amount from the deposit. it's just annoying and frustrating to go through that still."
reddit,2021-01-07 09:32:46,"does anyone else feel frustrated by the lack of discourse in india about the issues we face in daily lives? this is in ahmedabad. when i open the newspaper or the news sites, there's hardly anything about the garbage dumps growing in size everyday, the extreme dust pollution and the water that tastes like brine because ground water levels are decreasing alarmingly.

instead the paper talks about some nonsense some random politician said, some ads featuring government officials inagurating a railway line in far away up and some news about a few people arrested for possessing a few bottles of liquor.

it has been so many months since the municipality cleaned up the streets. the roads in the area have been destroyed for the 1000th time this year because the drainage lines overflow and the water seeps into the roads and makes it potholed. this is in an upscale area where a 2 bhk goes for over 80 lakhs. yet illegal construction is everywhere and debris are dumped on the road causing severe pollution.          . 

i find it frustrating to see no one giving a thought about basic hygiene in public places, pollution and other issues. the rich and middle class are happy living inside their ac and air purifier sanitized bubble. will this ever change?

reddit,2021-01-09 23:25:04,"gujarat has become a hotbed of corruption and the state of the highway here is an example of this. roads improve magically when you cross into rajasthan. i traveled from gujarat to rajasthan today after almost a year. the highways of gujarat were very good till 2018. you always felt that the toll collection was justified. today however i was shell shocked. the entire stretch from ahmedabad to the rajasthan border is completely damaged in the name of road construction. they charge you almost rs. 1.5 per kilometer for roads that should not even be legal. work has stopped for years and locals have put up their shop banners on the rusted fyover pillars. take a look at the pics.

this is very dangeous and on this stretch we saw 4 overturned trucks because the roads are narrower than a small street and huge trucks and cars and cattle and goats all go through them. tbis on a road that costs 1.5 per km in toll and has been in this state for over 2.5 years.

i traveled on this in 2018 and it was fantastic. now they have destroyed the good road and are charging tolls.

why corruption? just pass into rajasthan. the entire stretch is fantastic like a runway. same road, same toll and same nhai. construction is happening fast and unlike gujarat there's no rust or painted signs on the pillars due to inactivity.

even the state highways are going bad. every year they dig up good roads and lay them again while not filling up the potholes on the bad roads.

i have lived here for over 25 years since childhood and i have never seen things this bad. it hurts to see thousands of crores being wasted on digging up good roads and then building them again. it hurts to see so much government money being dumped here. corruption has increased a lot in recent years.

i need to move back to bangalore end of this month to start working from the office again and i'm on the lookout for a house. koramangala is the obvious choice to optimise for a short commute.   


the problem is, most of my time in bangalore was spent at home because of covid, and a quick twitter search on 'koramangala' only shows power cuts, flooding, road constructions, etc. some of which i have experienced.   


should i just roll with it and continue to look for a place close to work, or are areas like indiranagar, hsr layout, mg road, and others a better choice?"

reddit,2021-02-11 04:24:25,"my horrible experience giving out my downstairs house for rent. so in the month of october i gave out my 1bhk house for rent to this guy and his wife and her brother. he came and occupied the house on oct 20th and said that he will be giving the security deposit of 50k (rent was 7k) at the start of the next month. i thought fine, it's just after lockdown what can go wrong.

so the next month he gives the 10-day rent of oct and also only 30k rent and says he will give the rest in the month of december. all good i thought. 

the trouble however started from day one. i've rented out properties for a long time, been a tenant myself as well. usually when a tenant moves in they're pretty quiet and chill and it all goes fine, but not this time. these people would stay up all night and sleep all day. i have nothing against that but staying up and making so much noise(banging on doors, speaking at the top of their lungs etc) at 3am is just unacceptable. my parents are a retired couple who just want to get some sleep and not be disturbed. i too would be up all night but it was all work related. these people didnt work, according to the guy he had a fish selling business. i would go downstairs and tell them to keep it down, and that my parents needed to sleep. they would stay quiet for like 5 mins and then the noise started again. eventually the noise died down by like 5am when i guess they would go to sleep. of course this didn't happen every night but it happened enough for my parents to lose a lot of sleep and be groggy for the most part. 

the guy would also smoke like a chimney and all that smell would rise up and come into our home. the smell was unbearable.

there were other incidents as well like they would leave our front gate open all the time, which led to the local dogs to get in and shit all over our compound. i would tell him he would say ok and then proceed to not do said thing. it was getting really frustrating dealing with the guy and his family. and also initially he was living with his wife and her brother, but then the guy's 2 daughters, the wife's sister, the guy's couple of friends all started living in that house, which was fine but the amount of water they would spend was going through the roof.

so we decided to give him a month's notice and told him to leave the house on jan 1st. we had to endure all the problems for another month then jan 1st came and there was no signs that he was going to leave the house. he also didn't give the rest of the security deposit or any of the rent since november. he asked us for another 10 days as he was still looking for another house. we thought alright another 10 days but that's it.

jan 10th, i go downstairs and knock on the door, no answer. i call his phone he doesn't pick up. after about 2 hours he calls back and says that he is in andhra pradesh for some business related thing. i ask when is he gonna leave the house. he says he will do it in a couple of days and hangs up. this was the last straw. at this point after cutting the two months rent with electricity bill, water bill, and also since he didnt even leave the house on 10th i would have to take january month's rent too, the security deposit had only rs 4000 left. so we decided to go to the cops and tell them to do something.

on jan 12th we went to the cops and he was summoned to the police station. at the police station the guy says that he is having money troubles and that he can only vacate the house on jan 31st. i did not like that. another 15 days of sleepless nights for my parents was crazy. but the cops gave assurance that if anything happened i just had to call them and that he would vacate the house on jan 31st. reluctantly i agreed but i said that he would have to give me something in the form of security deposit as i would have to account for any damages if any. he said that he would be able to give rs 5000 and i agreed. i also told the cops to take a written statement of all this and that i wanted a copy.

no here's where the story gets interesting. a few days later on jan 18th half a dozen people ring our doorbell at 10pm. they said they were from crime branch, showed us ids and asked us who was living in our rented house. we told them and they asked if we had a spare key to the house as the guy or anybody weren't inside, and that they really needed to get inside to do a search. by the time i got the key the guy showed up and they went inside and were searching for something. the crime branch people never gave us any details, just said that this guy was involved. now i'm not a prejudiced guy but the guy was muslim and crime branch showing up like this was all a bit fishy to me.

the vehicle they were in had govt of karnataka stickers on it. after a while all of them got into their vehicle and left taking the guy with them. so after this the house remained empty till feb 2nd.

on jan 29th i call him and he doesnt answer. i call his wife's brother, and ask him when they will vacate the house. he says they will do it soon. i ask him where the guy is. he says he is in jail. i ask why. he says he doesnt know.

then, on feb 2nd the guy shows up in the middle of the night and asks to get inside the house (i had taken the keys off of him). he says that he wants to take out something from inside and i get suspicious. i call the cops and they show up and then he tells them that he will vacate the house the next day. but right now he needs to get inside and take something. so finally i open the door and me the guy and a cop go inside. the whole house is a mess, he goes in and opens the wardrobe and removes a load of cash. he says its about 2.5 lakhs. i ask him if he had the cash why didnt he pay rent? to which he replies he didnt want to. i dont know if this guy had some mental illness or what. but that was just idiotic. then he leaves comes back the next day packs up everything and leaves.

after he leaves i check the house properly. the damages to the house was immense. he broke the commode and the tap in the bathroom, the walls had scorch marks all over the place, i guess he was putting out his cigarettes on the walls.

all in all the money which he gave as security deposit was not enough to cover the damages and i told him that he had to pay more. to which he flat-out refused. the guy hasn't shown his face or is picking up my calls. i figure whatever, i am too tired to go behind this guy for a few bucks. atleast now my parents can sleep at night peacefully.

tl;dr: gave a guy and this family my 1bhk for rent. they were absolute nuisances and they didnt pay rent or give enough security deposit. they stayed for an extra month after notice period. the guy also was arrested by crime branch and was maybe involved in some shady shit. finally the house was vacated and there were a lot of damages. but i didnt want to go after him for it."

i am seeking help to go about fixing lack of water supply to our 35-year old house in north bengaluru. i had approached the bwssb inspector. a lineman came over to inspect the integrity of the connection at the water meter. after disengaging those connections, he apparently cleaned a filter and inspected for any local blockages. he then connected the pipes back and asked us to check if there was any ingress of water into the sump the next day. there wasn't, and the meter reading didn't move.

the bwssb inspector now says that since there is regular supply of water to the neighbours, the problem is with our connection to the main pipe (which lies underground on the opposite side of the road). we would need to apply to the bbmp for road cutting permission and have it inspected and fixed. this permission alone would cost rs. 40k, apart from other expenses.

is this the right way to go about it? what if the fault lies locally within our property that could be more easily fixed, precluding the need to dig across the road to the mainline? whom can i approach for help in this matter?

thanks."

reddit,2021-03-21 12:12:36,"my experience with real estate search and guide for newbies looking to buy home few months back i posted on here about how to start with real estate search as a newbie and got few comments on that thread, but nothing clear cut enough to give me a head start. this was a thing i was procrastinating for 4-5 years, because i had zero knowledge on the subject &amp; was hoping someone will spoon feed me (lol). so i finally took it upon myself and did detailed research. this is my experience in past 2 months of search and this is going to be a long read

1. **price** - first settle in on the price that you can afford maximum. don't think of unrealistic prices, in the hope that you will work harder to pay that or i will somehow make the extra money over my budget. choose the price based on your financial comfort zone and least risk. if your budget is maximum 50 lakhs stick to it. if your budget is 1 crore, then stick to the same. set your search based on that. just so you're aware, covid has not had much impact on the prices that are being quoted. it's still the same or maybe little less in some cases. 

2. **area** - if you have a proper area in mind, then well and good for you. if not, here's how you can go ahead. filter out prime areas of city (koramangala, indiranagar, jayanagar, malleshwaram, etc) as these will be out of your zone. now have a shortlist of tier 2 &amp; 3 areas in the city. don't have a shortlist of more than 5-6 areas, as larger the list, the larger you will feel exhausted and likely to give up.

3. **travel** - this is really important to get you out of the blocks. roaming around the areas you have shortlisted. take 2 weekends and tour all these areas over the weekend and see if you like that area, the transport connectivity, surroundings, etc. in that process, note down under construction properties you liked while touring. i mention under construction here because for completed properties, you will need to pay in full and that's not everyone's cup of tea, plus the price will be on higher side.


4. **choosing builder** : after visiting all the areas, by now you will have the top 2 areas in mind. the next thing hardest thing is choosing the builder. first check for reputed builders in bangalore (prestige, salarpuria, brigade, puravankara, mahaveer, sobha, snn, vaishnavi etc). i have avoided mantri here since it's into big problems at the moment.

go through each developers website and check for their projects and filter down the projects that come under your area. check if your project is registered with rera (by default most projects will be).



**checking builder reputation :**

https://rera.karnataka.gov.in/viewallprojects

go here and type the rera registration number of projects you have filtered. here every detail to the minutest will be available in rera. details include, project completion date, plan, bda/bbmp approval, contractor for the projects, complaints raised by consumer on the project. you can also get complaints raised on the company in general in the tab ""complaints on the promoter"". some will be under partnership names. 

this will help you have a rough idea of the reputability of the builder. the lesser the complaints, the better which is obvious. 

**site visit :** now you have the basic information about the project (project completion date, contractor, approval) and armed with this info go to all project sites. sales person will brief you about the project and stuff. he will give you delivery period, pricing and stuff. 

**potential red flags:**

check if the delivery period matches with the one they have got approval from rera. if it doesn't match, the sales person is just plainly lying and they are desperate to sell it to unsuspecting people. ask them who is the contractor and if they bluff around saying, we build on own, although in rera site you saw someone else being contractor, then that's another major red flag. for example quite a few projects have simplex infrastructures as contractor, but they are running in loss and several projects are stalled. a half decent builder would not lie about these things and will try to be as direct as possible to sell, without having to resort to lies.

**questions to be asked in site visit** :

* does the project come under bbmp or panchayat or bda. if under bbmp will it have kaveri water connection at time of completion. [areas that don't come under bbmp, won't have kaveri water and hence ask them if water softner is there inside the project for ground water]. also ask about sewage disposal method.

* ask about their other projects and their completion time. their ongoing projects and progress on those (check the same if what they said and rera matches)

* what is the price per sqft including car park. they will show you price per sqft of your house only and won't show car park price in per sqft as law says it shouldn't be, but they use a loophole to show it separate. also ask what are the floor raise charges ? (this means the higher the floor, the extra you have to pay). ask what's the discount currently they are offering per sqft. bargain very well with the points you have in hand.

* ask about which banks have approved this project (this will help you in loan)

* if the project comes under a khata. if b khata you will be in problem.

* what's the maintenance charge per sq ft after 1st year. what are the approximate rents going in this area for such a setup. (verify that by searching rental homes in that area)

* how much % is the uds (undivided share which means how much part of the house is your land share). this should be part of your agreement. 35-40% would be decent, but most offer 30 odd.

* whether late delivery compensation will be part of agreement.

* if in a project there are 2-3 towers and vacancy seems to be more in a particular tower, question them why is that so and dig to find out the reasons. 

* if they have left a huge space free enough in their project land and say that it will be for future recreational purposes ask them about that plan. some builders mark it to build extra tower later in the future and don't inform customers about it. so see if that space might affect your tower.

* check the 4 sides of your project land and see if there's possibility of other projects coming up in future, which might hinder your view from the tower you are planning to.



**pricing schedule** : go for the builder that offers you a good payment schedule over 2-3 years. most builders have this schedule, where after a particular floor is completed, then you have to pay your due. a drawback in this method is by 1-1.5 years they can just raise the building to the maximum floor and 80% of your cash will be locked by just 1 year. some builders offer every 2-3 months till the project completion time (in this method the drawback, you have to just trust your developer).


these are obviously few points and there are many more like floor plans and questions surrounding that, questions related to amenities, etc etc. but this can give you a headstart and if you have any more queries feel free to dm me."
reddit,2021-03-26 11:42:06,"feeling lonely in bengaluru? this is how i made new friends i came to bengaluru in early 2018 after my studies. i knew only one person before, who was my roommate. we were old friends at school. so i stayed with him at his double sharing pg room, where he invited me.

i spent around a month shuttling between job hunt interviews and my room. my roommate had a night shift work and we used to talk less as we would meet for very little time. so in short, i had no other friends and spent time alone on most days. my roommate would be asleep during the day and i'd be in and out of the room attending interviews. when i was in the room, i'd be watching movies on my laptop or scrolling through social media posts on my mobile.

one day at 11am when i was sleeping in my room after i returned, there was a powercut. it was only when i went out for lunch that i saw there was power everywhere except in our pg. i searched for the care-taker but, he was missing. i forgot it soon as i had an interview in the evening. 

after i returned, i called the owner (he was someone who took the building on lease for this pg). he said the care-taker was swindling money and did not pay the bescom bills since last 3 months. so they had cut the power supply. i also learnt that they had removed the fuse last month but the care-taker used another one to restore power. this time bescom cut the supply from the post and only they could restore it. i was irritated. my phone was almost out of charge and my laptop was dead. we had no clue when the power would be restored.

so, i had to keep my phone switched off for most of the time and i decided to go outside my room. i met a lot of other folks at the pg and all of them faced the same mobile charge issue. my roommate knew a shop owner nearby and we kept our phone for charging, there.

i soon became friends with the shop keeper. since it was hot inside the room at my pg, i started spending more time outside the room. i became friends with other pg mates and some neighbours. one of them invited me for lunch at his room. so i started keeping my phone for charge there. slowly i grew a network of friends there.

later when i changed my job and found it hard to get accommodation at the new place, one of the pg mates i knew helped me out. right now, i feel glad that there was a powercut which forced me to move out of my room and make friends. would not have happened if i was sitting indoors glued to a mobile or laptop screen.

ps - power was restored after 3 days when the owner paid the bill. the care-taker was never seen after that"

reddit,2021-03-31 21:25:56,"issues with cauvery water connection to our house our house is a 40 year old house. we have been receiving cauvery water through a connection established by directly connecting our house water line to that of main cauvery line laid by bbmp which is opposite to our house all these years. our house taps into the last point on the line. this connection has been functional for the last 40 years. however over the recent times, since our house connection is at the last point on the line, they (bwssb)say it has a tendency to get blocked/ clogged. hence over the last few years we have been suffering an acute shortage of cauvery water to our house. our neighbor's however receive copious amounts of water every time bwssb supplies water. currently our only option is to tap into the main water line from a point which is diagonally opposite to our house ( also our neighbors tapping point) and connect our water line to this point.
bwssb has washed off their hands and is refusing to take on the burden and responsibility of cutting the road and ensuring that the water connection to our house is established again. can anyone here advice and recommend a good licensed bwssb plumber who would do a good job at getting the necessary permissions from bbmp for road cutting ,and fitting the new line without charging us heftily. would be forever grateful. this problem has been plaguing us for over three years now.and the unfortunate thing is that it is only our house which has been effected by this in our entire street."
reddit,2021-04-10 23:29:34,"apps to change this city 1: public eye - this app allows to report traffic related offences like rash driving, no parking, rider no wearing helmet. offender will be fined within 2-3 days.
[public eye](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichangemycity.publiceye)

2: i change my city - this were you can raise variety of complaints related to your ward like potholes, dug up roads, public toilet issues, lack public transport, water problems, installation of new street lights, clearing garage dump sites etc. issues are resolved slow here when compared to public eye but if enough people raise the complaints it should bring some change.

near my house, there are roads dug up everywhere in the name of what? how can people commute in case of any emergency? 

and the power cuts omg! is our city becoming that smart? in case of heavy wind there's a power cut some light showers there's a power cut."
reddit,2021-04-12 12:33:44,"intrigued by the constant wastage of water from water tankers for as long as i've lived in bangalore (15 years almost) i've always noticed water tankers on roads, in my apartment etc. which constantly seem to be leaking water from some pipe or hole. i honestly don't understand why the water companies can't put a stop to this wastage of water. i also don't get why this problem is rarely talked about by the public or in the media. do y'all know why such an issue persists?"
reddit,2021-04-16 09:25:34,"is there an advantage to buying a house near a lake ? there have been mixed opinions on this. some people say having a lake near by would retain better ground water levels. can anyone chime in on this subject especially considering water scarcity is a big problem in bangalore.

if the lake does indeed help, any preferred radius from the lake should the house be to reap the benefit ?"

""give them shelter""

please understand what i'm trying to say, if u have already made up your mind to show hate then please skip. i myself have a golden  at home and truly am a dog lover.

&amp;#x200b;

there are 10 street dogs in my area, 9 grown-ups and 1 puppy ( around 4-5 months in age). these dogs are treated with a lot of care by the people in my locality, given food 3 times a day, when it rains we let them into our houses and even when it is too hot, i myself go and give them water. it's all good in the day time, the problem starts in the night and even people in my locality are not able to take it anymore. 

these dogs are fed around 10:00-10:30ish by the people and by 11:30 idk what ends up happening to these dogs, they start barking.  just imagine 10 dogs barking at the same time all night ! they literally look at each other and start barking. this barking has become such a normal thing here, around 5 months back a thief had come and had robbed footwear from almost all households, they barked as usual, no one even cared as it was a daily thing. this has become a major issue now, not only me, but a lot of people in my locality are looking at these dogs are a burden. literally all nights have become sleepless nights. from 11:30pm to 4am of continuous barking of 10 dogs is too much to take lightly. people are taking a decision not to feed these dogs so they will go away, but i am sure that is not the case. someone with a solution please help me out !"

reddit,2021-08-10 13:40:07,"best &amp; worst of my experiences while driving 6300 kms from pune-dehradun-lucknow-delhi-pune some special mentions of my best and worst experiences during this recently concluded road trip spanning 6300 kms across 7 states, 130 cities and consuming 450 litres of petrol on honda wrv:

best city: indore

mind totally blown away, while staying for 12 hrs at indore. amazing vibes of this city, something out of the world. not a big city, neither small, just the right size. vibrant night life, majestic malls, superb roads, neat and clean ambience, and some extraordinary food. people are nice, considerate, patience and big hearted. will definitely visit there again, and stay for atleast a week. 

worst city: gwalior

i mean, i couldn't find roads there. only potholes. it seems roads were build around the potholes there. pathetic condition. had a plan to visit the massive fort there, but the roads prevented me. sad. 

best food: indore

night time food adventure at sarafa bazaar and a short visit to the pub at malhar mall left a lasting impression. the quality and variety of food at sarafa bazar was outstanding. 

best highway: agra-lucknow yamuna expressway

301 kms of pure bliss. average speed 120, with no hiccups. no pots, smooth road, wide arena, and seamless flow. 

worst highway: entire mp

the biggest problem on the highways in mp is not potholes.. i mean, after a point of time, you realise the meaning of your life, and the potholes' role in solving the mystery of life. but the biggest problem was cows. its cows everywhere on the national highways! saw atleast 500 cows during 700-odd kms of drive in-and-around gwalior, chambal, guna, indore. cows simply roaming on the national highways, everywhere. literally everywhere. 

most scenic highway

nashik-pune expressway, handsdown. it's still being made, but the scenery along the highway is mesmerising. right from indore to nashik, the entire route is very scenic, filled with tribal areas, vast untouched land and dense forests. 

pune-lonawala-mumbai expressway is no doubt breath-taking, but nashik-pune expressway is something different. in mp, the highways near kuno wildlife on gwalior-indore route was also beautiful, but the bad roads made it look bad. 

best budget hotel: udaipur.

when you steal a deal under 2000 bucks and get a large, ancient haveli and swimming pool all for yourself, then its pure delight. icing on the cake was the story about ghosts and haunted hallways there. more details later!

most restless traffic: surat.

very erratic, rash and fast traffic. i don't think traffic rules are appreciated there!

most considerate traffic cops: jaipur

cops stopped our car. there was no puc. i told them that honda showroom guys told no puc is needed for first year. they told puc is needed after 6 months of buying a new car in rajasthan. but i bought from pune, i told them. but your car is allegedly causing pollution in rajasthan, they told. damn. kya karna hai bataiye, i pleaded. acha jao, bahut door se aa rhe ho, bahut door jaana hai. par, rajasthan ghoom ke jaana, they made sure to made me smile.

scary phase: unstoppable rain at agra-mathura stretch, chambal valley and between gwalior-indore. the rain drops were lashing out like they were bullets. had to stop the car, and wait. huge currents of water sweeping across the highways like it's a river. dark cloud, almost night-like scene at evening 3, lightning, and suddenly in-shorts notifying me that red alert has been announced at the very spot where i was waiting for the rain to stop. it was a bit scary!

special thanks to brand honda.

drove these 6300 kms on honda wrv, and a superb experience all this while. no unexpected breakdowns, tyre puncture or any over-heating issue. drove for 5-6 hours non-stop with full ac, at 150 kms highest speed, curves, valleys and hills. 

seamless driving experience. visited couple of honda workshops at lucknow and had a very great experience there as well. honda is definitely a brand you can trust."

&amp;#x200b;

i came to my parents' home (a different city than where i live) for this week. now my parents are away, and only my younger sister is here (that's why i came). unexpectedly some guests (my father's cousin - my aunt, and her husband) show up and are staying at our place. they're here to get some medical checkups done.

today it's my aunt's birthday, and they decided to go out for a dinner, and drag me as well (i hate going out but i had to go). unfortunately, our car isn't here atm, and i booked a cab to the restaurant. now right after dinner, they decided to go on for a stroll (c'mon! i was already dead). while strolling my great (/s) sister suggested getting some ice cream from her favourite place (i'm pissed now, and i just wanted to get back into my room asap). i took my phone out and started searching for a cab but before i could book any, my uncle stopped an auto-rickshaw and asked us to hop in.

now, there were 4 of us, and autos have like space for only 3 people, so one of us had to sit in the front with the driver; of course, it had to be me or my uncle. i was like - meh, okay, i'll sit. now, the auto dropped us at our location, and while dropping the driver asked if we'd like to take the same auto to return as well. i told him that my home isn't where you picked us off from. he told us that he'd drop us back at our home. he also added that he needs this as he has an mba and currently doing this part-time because he lost his job due to covid-19. well, okay, ""you can drop us home"".

as we were about to leave the ice-cream place, i called him to check if he can come to pick us up. surprisingly, he was already there. maybe he didn't get any rides.

alright, things start to escalate now. he was chatty. since he had told me about his lost job, i got curious and started having a conversation with him (i was sitting in front). he told me that he was sales lead or sth similar at parle, and due to covid, they cut his salary to half (he was earning 35k earlier). i believed him. we started diving deeper into the conversation, about how this is happening to a lot of people, and all. then he asked me about my job. now my stupid ass told him the truth (i'm a software engineer in a faang like company). he asked me if i'm working from home, and if i live here only. i told him that i'm here at my parents' home, and i live in a different city (stupid me, naive me!).

during this conversation, he subtly slides in a question about my salary. i earn \~2l pm, and i didn't wanna share my actual salary, therefore i lied... but!!! what a fucking lie - i just said: ""1"" (idk what was going on inside my brain). yes, i'm a really stupid person. i'm not that good with people. i'm naive. he asked - ""per month?"". my stupid ass brain reacted - ""hmm"". yep, my brain cells are fucked up. all of this was happening while my sister, uncle and aunt were having loud conversations in the back about dogs as far as i remember. i don't think they had any idea about what was going on in the front seat.

i had disclosed sensitive information to a total stranger. i got quiet all of a sudden. he kept chatting about the roads (potholes, etc). i was replying passively, or not replying at all now. i got paranoid and asked him questions about where his office was. he told me that his office was in the same city as the one i currently live in. i asked the area of his office and he answered the question. i couldn't confirm the correctness of his answer back then. now, he dropped us home (now he knows the address as well). i asked him to drop us outside our colony gate so that he doesn't know the exact address but the folks in the back seat asked him to drop us inside the colony and told him the exact address. i was like - :\\.

as soon as he dropped us, i rushed back into my room, opened my laptop and checked the location of his office. he lied.

writing this post here to tell y'all that i fucked up today. i'm super anxious right now, and i don't know what to do next. using a throwaway account (sorry for that) as i'm done sharing my info now. would appreciate any suggestions on what i can do now."

while it is okay to rant on social media and r/india, it may also help to refresh your high-school civics lessons – remember union list subjects, state list subjects, and panchayat raj? central and state officials and elected leaders have clearly segregated accountability. government officials make us run around by pointing fingers across these boundaries. for example

* **street light not working,** water supply shut off in your neighborhood, potholes on local roads? start with the local utility’s helpline or complaint app. if not, call your local councilor/corporator. you may need to look up the ward/subdivision of city council you live in. 
* **issue with schools and colleges?** start with local education board officials. if that doesn’t help, approach the local mla/mlc or mp if a centrally managed school (like kv) or college 
* **rowdy menace in your neighborhood?** start with local police station, move up to commissioner. if that doesn’t help, approach the local mla/mlc 
* **issues with land title?** start with local city council or panchayat. move up the hierarchy upto the dc. eventually approach the local mla/mlc and then the minister (like i am trying to do with [my petition](https://www.change.org/revenuekarnataka)) 
* **price of gas, petrol etc?** sure, blame bjp, modi and the center

but this post is about their helpline. from last few months, it has been very handy! whenever there are power cuts, i call them and a real person picks up on the other side usually under a minute. if it's scheduled maintenance, i'm given an eta. if not, they register a complaint and in most case power is restored in about 15 - 20 minutes!

now the cherry on top, there was a power cut in the middle of the night yesterday. i decided to give it a shot and called them at 1 am and was pleasantly surprised to connect to a person! as usual, she raised the complainant and power was back in 15 minutes.

there were 5 other guys, who were staring at me continuously. they were discussing something in their mother tongue about me. they were drinking whiskey from paper box.

i got down at koramangala around 1:30 am. the drunkard gang  alighted with me and started following me. i asked siri, 5 drunkards following me, what shall i do?

siri: run as if your life depends on it.

i started running, but the gang caught up with me quickly.

i asked siri, the drunkards are catching up, what shall i do?

siri: run faster and whoever catches you first, pepper spray him

i run faster, one slim guy caught up with me, i took out pepper spray from my vanity bag and sprayed it on his face. nothing happened to him, his gang caught me quickly.

i yelled at siri, the gang caught up again, what shall i do now?

siri: take off mask and sneeze on them loudly and tell that you are corona positive

i took off my double mask and sneezed on them and said i was corona positive.

the gang panicked and switched off their mobile phone, they had gau rogya setu app installed, which will flag them in close contact with corona positive case.

bbmp, police, gau rogya setu gang, rt pcr test gang would  make their life hell.

i'm sorry i don't have any pictures of the sink but honestly why would anyone do that. it's literally a flat slab of granite with taps over them and a tiny drainage cut out at the end. which architect thought, ""oh to hell with the usual bowl like sinks people have been using for ages. let's make it flat. they're gonna love it"". like why try solving a problem that never existed. 
  
the water just splashes all over if you don't have your hand directly under the spout as the water comes out with quite some pressure. and it's not the aerated tap either. it comes out like from a toilet jet spray and just splashes like crazy. and even me being 5' 7"" requires me to lean over and stretch to access the tap. and the distance between the water spout and the electronic sensor that turns on the water is so far away. usually you keep your hand near the spout and the sensor is triggered. but nope, some smart ass decided it's a good idea to keep the sensor a good 15cms away from the spout, for which i have to lean over even more. and since the granite slab is flat with barely a slight angle to it. all the tiny food particles from when you wash your hand stay on the slab and it makes the experience all the more disgusting.

i only recently started learning to ride a bike. been a scooter guy for years but the bikes are beginning to rub onto me. really enjoying it.

i'm looking to invest in a new bike. a little bit about me and what i am looking for:

1. i'm a beginner and comfortable riding bikes upto 350cc (haven't tested higher). 5'7"" weighing at almost 92 kgs

2. mostly going to be used in the city (90% of the time). once office opens i'll be mostly stuck in traffic and also running into heck lot of potholes

3. i've never toured before. i love taking rides into the inner streets (think potholes, speed bumps, random cows and dogs, etc)

4. i like a comfortable riding position (definitely not the r15 kind)

5. require a good pillion comfort (think elderly woman)

6. dual channel abs and good after sales support (my earlier scooter had fuck ton of issues. want to visit garage as infrequently as possible lol)

as of now, these are my priorities.

so far i've tested only the r15 and the cb350.

the cb350 excites me. one issue is that its a heavy bike and boy do i have a lot of run inns with street dogs and so being swift to turn and ride away is super important (have been stuck in nasty deadends that require me to turn asap and fast). that point is not much of a concern but i've never owned a bike before and so am not sure if cruisers will be optimal for slow moving traffic and pothole infested roads. considering its got a low mileage already, i'll spend a lot just to travel to and fro.

please do provide your suggestions. thanks in advance!"

reddit,2022-01-23 07:21:34,"now i am realising, behind poor governance is poor journalism based on a small study based on anecdotal evidence and personal experience.

we’ve stayed 34 years of our lives in chandigarh and we could barely associate with anything that we can remotely say as mischievous, misgovernance, that makes you feel utterly powerless and voiceless.

last 18 months, we have been staying in punjab and life is miserably distressing but is full of observations.

1. no electricity for days in cities.
at times, no electricity for 3 days out of the 7 in a week (this is when the demand is low).

absolutely no electricity in villages.
and that’s the norm.

2. traffic jams on not only conventional, interior roads but even on highways connecting cities.

3. no policing.
alcoholics make merry. can stop their vehicles wherever, whenever they want. 
no questions asked.


all this, when we are staying in the constituency of the chief minister, barely 15 kms away from chandigarh.


observation:

there appears to be one important reason behind all this: no journalism whatsoever.

in chandigarh, slightest potholes appear on the front pages of the newspapers, forcing prompt actions.

in punjab, journalistic life is complacent.
making political life even more complacent.

complaints stay unheard for months if not for years.

politics seems mere as a power struggle with no or little emphasis on quality of services being provided to the citizens.

making me realise in this small microcosm:

when journalists falter, 
political class will.


p.s. - 
the private cost of living rises significantly when one lives in a place with poor governance.

since we could afford, we now have massive water filteration system installed as the water quality is said to be poisonous (according to kent ro executive). many people have that now.

we are in the process of buying a personal genset. 
everyone around us have one.

we only know a few details of this case from media accounts, but most say that the girl was rundown while crossing the busy road by climbing over the divider. i have driven by this stretch of road a number of times and it is an extremely busy junction with traffic rushing to get on the flyover towards the airport and to the ring roads. motorists don’t expect pedestrians crossing this stretch because there are 2-3-foot-high medians dividing opposite lanes.

opposing views on underpass. as one can see in the photograph, there is an underpass just near the busy bus stop. the bbmp commissioner was quoted saying “in this particular incident, i don’t want to discuss who is at fault. police will decide that based on their investigation,” gupta added, pointing out that the subway is in a usable condition. i inspected it. it is not dark or in an unusable state. pedestrians are using it even now.”

another account says “the girls were crossing the road from the seeds corporation side to the hebbal police station around 12.50 pm. police personnel had flagged the bbmp officials about the waterlogged subway at 9 am and asked them to clear the water.” however, the bbmp personnel arrived at the spot only after the accident and cleared the water.

----

whatever the real reason, one fact remains – **do not cross busy highways or roads with dividers.** tell your kids, cousins and other youngsters. **a life is simply too precious to lose this way.**

* it rains for several months every year. that’s nature and nothing new 
* rainwater needs somewhere to flow. again, nature at work 
* many major drains as per the city map – rajakaluve and storm water drains have been encroached by unscrupulous builders
* government land (gomala) in low lying areas have been illegally encroached. again, by unscrupulous builders
* when it rains, houses in low-lying areas get flooded. roads are flooded leading to massive traffic jams.

we point to the corporation bbmp and to local officials wondering why they aren’t doing much. we just don’t want to talk at the real issue

* we (homebuying public) encourage greedy, unscrupulous builders since they offer ‘cash’ deals on buildings and help convert ‘black’ money to white
* we (the public) love greedy, unscrupulous builders since they mark-down value of sales, and help avoid property tax 
* we (the public) love greedy, unscrupulous builders who avoid amenities like connecting to drains, or rainwater harvesting since it adds to cost of property 
* we (homebuyers) encourage builders to bribe officials to look the other way while approving building plans 

builders and homebuyers don’t pay much tax. we encroach on public land, and cut corners when it comes to building-plans and mess up with “city plan”.....  and when it floods and we all take to social media and post pictures about crumbling infrastructure

reddit,2022-05-23 21:16:21,"gurgaon is the worst place i've ever been to basically i'm from uttarakhand, not the mountainous part but the plains one. i've been  into fair share of large cities like gwalior, meerut, jabalpur, ujjain, jammu, haridwar, dehradun, jaipur, agra, bhopal, prayagraj and many more. all this rant is based on the experiences of these cities as well.

a week ago, i came to gurgaon to give some exams. what i'd heard about gurgaon was that it is a very huge city, a sister of delhi, booming with infrastructural growth, is one of the most developed cities of india.

but when i came here, the reality is all together very different.

the first problem i encountered after coming down here was the attitude of ola/uber auto drivers. literally no one accepted the booking as it was a bit inside the enclave. don't understand this behavior. i somehow managed to find an auto. i specifically told the driver to take that one particular route, but he fucked up and stopped at some goddamn locality. took me literally 2 hours to get to the house i'm staying in, while it should've taken only 15-30 minutes.

next, it's just so hot in here. it was like i've been shoved into a boiling oven. i've been to many cities, including the hot and semi-arid places like gwalior, meerut, etc. but the story here was something else. it was as if i was walking in the middle of a f\*cking desert.

and the road here are literally nonexistent. where are the roads? all i found was some off-road paths laded with potholes, gravel and sand. so much construction and no one bothers to clear their sh\*t up. just gravel and sand all over the place. the roads here literally made me cry.

and don't even get me to start on the public transport system. it's abysmal, to say the least. a person have to depend entirely on ola/uber to go from one place to another. bus stops are just for showpiece.

this morning, it rained heavily. as expected, the streets waterlogged very quickly. understandable. but the condition was the same even after more than 10 hours since rain. it rained in the morning, i went to give paper in the afternoon at 2, returned at 5 and the condition was just the same. where the hell is the drainage system? why there are no drains? you have just covered the entire ground with concrete, had built no drains. do you expect that the water will magically disappear?

there's no beauty in this city. no trees, no eye-pleasing architecture. just tall concrete towers everywhere. i literally couldn't find a single garbage bin and sulabh shauchalayas. i live near rezang la road, and what else i can say about this except that, it's horrible, truly very horrible.

what the hell is local government doing? don't they know of the problems of the common citizens? why are they sleeping? i understand people have their own compulsion to live in this sh\*thole, but i couldn't stand a minute of it. maybe i'll be living in this in the future, but i pray to god that such day will never come.

it's a horrible, horrible city. zero sexiness, zero vibes, zero beauty.

sorry for the long rant. i just wanted to lash out and take out my frustration with this city.

**edit**: w.r.t.crime, i just keep my head down and go on with my business. it feels as if people here are high on weed or something. they would just stop their car in the middle of the road, just so that someone could hop in the car. you glare at them, and be prepared to look into the barrel of a gun. normally, i use autos and bikes, but someday i took the scooty (of the person i'm living with) and i seriously had to be extra 200% alert. in other places, you bump into someone, you'll try to solve the matter amicably, in gurgaon, you'll be dead before you open your mouth. so much cases of road rages.

this being said, my experiences with people here has been a tad good up until now. have not met such kind of people til now, and hope to not meet them till i stay here. the people i've met, were generally helpful and polite. guess, i'm lucky in this aspect."

what i want to know is what is that extra amount that i had to pay for? \[because for me, the electricity bill that bescom charges right now is daylight robbery.\] and how do i deal with such situations in the future i.e. whom should i contact here if a similar situation arises?"

reddit,2022-06-15 10:18:40,"one hour of rain = 12+ hours of powercut i guess this is an old story. it's such an old story that it's a non-story. it rained around 7:30pm yesterday. light wind. of course there was a power cut. it stopped raining at 10:00 pm or so. but the power didn't come back when the rain stopped.

when i call the bescom call centre, they're already so fed up of people in my area complaining that they gave me the subdivision officer's number. when i call the subdivision officer, he gives me the same old tired excuse of trees falling on the transmission lines, wires tripping because of rain, or whatever. he vaguely promises at 11 that the power will be restored at 12. and he talks as if i'm asking for his kidney by asking him the all-important questions. but at the stroke of midnight, the power doesn't return, and doesn't return, and doesn't return...

before everyone tells me to buy an inverter, that's not an option to me because i'm unsure of how much longer i'll be staying in bangalore. and given the length of such power cuts, even inverters will run out.

reddit,2022-06-21 00:28:49,"advice on remote work vs bangalore as a life choice firstly to give you some context, i will ask my exact questions about bengaluru at the end. 

i'm 24m working as a dev currently for a mumbai based company but working remotely since covid. we are free to work from home till the end of this year. prior to this i was in hyd for an year, and before that in pune for my internship.

my first dilemma now is if i should continue working remotely or work from office. both has its own pros and cons. by working remotely i save a lot on rent, expenses, unnecessary commute, get to live in a large house in my home town. however i sometimes feel isolated and even professionally i feel one should work closely with colleagues in a office/workplace setup as networking with people is easier and you learn a lot on the fly.

i was just thinking what to do next year if they call me at the office. i don't see myself living in mumbai and settling there. reasons for not choosing mumbai: crazy house prices, crowded, less opportunities for tech and developers. 

the next obvious choice that came to my mind was bangalore. for bangalore, i feel there's two sides to it. needless to say the tech scene is great, i'll always find opportunities in blr for tech. the people also seem to be fun and great. but in terms of cons,  

1. each day i come across people complaining about traffic, commuting, not getting taxis/cabs. i am ready to pay a higher amount for a house close to to office but nonetheless this problem seems really bad. finding home at walkable distance isn't easy from my previous experiences in other cities as in some tech parks or areas there are virtually no residential properties.

2. i recently also saw people not getting accommodation, even people with decent budgets aren't able to find satisfactory houses on rent, owners taking huge deposits, sometimes they don't smoothly return the deposit on leaving etc.

3. water and electricity problems. i have heard some of my friends complain about this that even in good societies sometimes there is a scarcity of water and sometimes power cuts.

i want to ask you all about the severity of the problems mentioned above and tell me what you think about it and if a person should move to this place. i have some of my friends who are here, and each day i see more people moving from wfh to bangalore and resuming work from office.

money/rent/expense is still not much of an issue but i don't think i'll be able to spend more than 2-2.5 hrs in commute daily, struggle for getting desired house on rent, no cabs, high auto fares etc. i don't mind paying a premium on things in a big city but it has to reflect in my quality of life.

kindly let me know what you guys feel or if i'm exaggerating my concerns. also happy to hear advice about remote work vs working from office for someone who's just 3 yrs into the professional world."

but we've also seen flooding. 

going ahead as time passes there's gonna be a million more problems from garbage disposal to water (not like we aren't already seeing this, but maybe on a larger scale) 

and at this point we're going nowhere man.

again and again dishonest bureaucrats and govt. from small contractors to the top, its just everywhere and its so annoying

we fail to learn from other cities. imagine if vrushabhavati was a clean fast flowing river instead of an open drainage system. imagine if the lakes were clean enough to support marine life much better than it does. the quality of livelihood wouldve gone up.

not like cleaning vrushabhavati wasn't possible. well look up london's river thames' history if you don't believe me. 

ok let's not go all the way till london, let's first learn from goa itself. the roads there are so fricken good. from highways to every single one of those million tiny roads connecting the ghats, not a single road is ignored. i barely came across any potholes there. when i told this to others i was told it's a tourist state so it has to have good roads. i mean wtf bangalore is india's silicon valley it deserves much better. 

not even kidding while coming back from goa to bangalore via the goa dharwad road/ghat sections, i could easily make out when i crossed over to k'taka. goan roads were wel tarred roads with a lot of road signs and good markings and just as i entered karnataka it was a concrete road with potholes covered using tar. not a single road sign, no markings but for sure a lot of half built structures. especially in front of dudhsagar water falls the roads were extremely bad. and as you get closer to dharwad the wide roads are literally just mud roads. its so annoying man

the goan roads always feel so fresh and i came across a lot of places where they were laying fresh tar. also unlike they do here, in goa the contractor himself was present and supervising stuff, at every single location. 

man bangalore has a lot of problems, its so evident that we citizens don't even need to highlight it. but what is done about it? literally nothing. 

there are a lot more problems like roads are purposely dug up after laying them new under the pretext of pipelines or drainage and left half filled for months before patch up. patch ups suck in levelling.

rent is too high only riding on demand. no quality no logic and no choice.

law and order is namesake

reddit,2022-06-23 19:43:04,"[serious] what can i do about the road in front of my house? this is a serious question that comes from a place of frustration, trying to figure out what can be done.

i'm facing two separate problems

problem 1

close to 2.5 years ago, the government dug up a road that most people would take to avoid the main road. this was used by motorists to avoid traffic police. the road was closed for more than 3-4 months and the work was partially abandoned because of rain. ultimately, the residents started complaining because they had to leave their cars in a field and walk to their home.

owing to this tension and fearing escalation, they closed the pit and opened the road. this road is a mud road and people were promised asphalting in the next 6 months.

it has been more than an year since this incident. the main road is now getting clogged every morning and taking this interior road to avoid traffic means you are either going to torture your suspension or break your back or both.

problem 2

about an year or so ago, government decided to bless us with pipelines. sanitation or drinking water, i still don't know. they dug up a beautiful road to lay pipes and complained that the rain was obstructing their work.

when the apartments nearby started creating a noise, the department quickly asphalted the road. this was just before some event happening around the area, btw.

mentally, i made a note of the date when this happen. in 3 months, just 3 months, wide  potholes started cropping up. these potholes have eroded all the tar on the road encroaching the entire width making it a pain to drive on these roads.

for the longest time, i did not care.

i, then, wanted to find a way. this is what i have done:

1. visited karnataka one, was redirected to bbmp
2. visited bbmp, didn't get a proper response
3. lodged a complaint on the bbmp whatsapp number, no response.
4. lodged a complaint on ichangemycity, no response.
5. lodged a complaint with bbmp portal, duly closed because that board is meant only for potholes and not for major road repairs

really, who do i reach to if i want to with my grievance?

i have 100% faith in this government and i know the tons of development work they're doing. i truly appreciate it and have been a die-hard loyalist of the government in power. i am not blaming anyone here, i just want to know how can i putforth my problem to the authorities, who are the relevant authorities and how can i know the reason for the road not being laid?"

i often see people here sharing their frustration over the infrastructure not helping in the city. for a lot of you who are coming into the city for the first time, i like to simply take an example of me riding on my bicycle from basavanagudi in south bangalore to vimanapura near marathalli where my grandparents stayed as an example over the years in terms of commute. the distance is about 19 km give or take. 

90s - my crazy young uncles could jet set on their motorbike in 20 mins 
mid 2000s - i often used to cycle to my grandparents place at least 2-3 times months. would take me about 45 minutes to get there in one direction. 
early 2010s - started taking me around 1 hour 15 mins due to an increase in traffic and also signals. i stopped cycling since the net health benefit of cycling was a loss considering how much smoke i had a breath in making such trips around the city. 
now - ola/uber can take up to 2 hours in peak traffic. 

it seems to me that the post pandemic rate of migration to the city is outpacing any other city in the country. i'm struggling to find sources where the net migration stats are easily accessible (people moving in - moving out). 

i'm getting a sense that there are almost no measures possible at the rate at which migration is happening into the city. the roads can't be widened, building more fly overs and under bridges choke the city even more, the metro construction is still very slow and connectivity to the airport is perhaps a 10 year dream. 

there are some other measures that can be taken like incentivising companies who implement 80% wfh with some sort of tax rebate to ease the stress on public infrastructure. but there are obviously people who own commercial office spaces (lots of politicians) and other lobbies (water, transport, etc) who will go against it. 

what can policymakers really do to keep up with such high levels of migration into the city? 

i've seen people doing a lot of ranting here about problems with bangalore and conversations either end with 
1. get out of my city of you don't like it (by a lot of natives like me)
2. accept that you have a problem (by folks who are migrating) 

i'm not against migration but i'm against people who just went to point to the problem having come to city to make this their home. we all know there is a problem and we're all living it.

have not really seen anyone discuss intelligent solutions here apart from usual wfh. 

i'll start with one idea that i thought can be useful and maybe you all can add to it.

while riding scooty, i dont usually cross speed of 30-40, cause its very light and prone to skidding especially during monsoon. i was on riding slowly on left lane on left corner so anyone who wishes to ride at high speed are free to do so without any obstruction from my side.

due to car passing over a very deep pothole, i was not able to see it until the last moment. my both tyres passed over the pothole resulting in me loosing control, thankfully due to my low speed i was able to stop the vehicle relatively quickly. 2 seconds later somebody crashed into my right side while coming from behind.

judging by the speed at which he crashed, it should be 60+. his bike crashed, skidding and taking him with it for 8-10m in middle of road. with a bus about to crush him and stopped barely few inches before a fatal accident. due to bus i was not able to see a lot so i jumped into action, saw the bus didnt harm and was relieved. helped the man remove his leg stuck between bike and road. took him to side and apologized. he was elderly and understood it was not my mistake. 

nobody came to help. literally nobody. everyone was watching from the bus, the cars looking from windows, the bikers stopping to enjoy the show. but not one single person came to lift the crashed bike. i was horrified after i started thinking when i reached home. my sidestand was broken, mirror broke and minor dent in right side.

but the more i think about it , the more it gets worse. if the man was crushed, it'd be on me. because nobody holds the muncipality accountable for accidents due to potholes. if the guy would've died, the same people who were watching the show without helping would not have hesitated to beat me up. there are jsut so many things going through my head. knowing my entire life would've been ended if the accident was fatal, despite no mistake on my part and entire fault on govt's side."

everyday many bikers are dying or getting seriously injured due to potholes and water that does not go away due to clogged drains. 
even our ""highways"" are in poor condition.

i've been staying in bangalore for over 13 years and to be honest, i kind of want to move away from this traffic but stay near the city because i love the place and have an emotional attachment to the city. 

i'm considering buying an apartment in yelahanka because its cheaper (and considering how much rent has increased in the city) and i plan to work remotely for as long as possible. 

i do not want to move to my native because of some family issues. what is your opinion about yelahanka area? are there water problems or anything else i should be considering? 

note: my gf is from bhopal and she keeps saying new bhopal is cleaner, much more organized and much cheaper place to buy an apartment. i looked up apartments in bhopal, yes it is much cheaper but hey, its not bangalore. anyone who stayed in bhopal can also chip in a little advice here.

i stay in a gated society paying a rent of 35k currently and plan to stay in gated societies only because of the security, crowd and amenities. and the idea of purchasing flat in a society seem to be a money drain in long term as so much water problem etc. and no one would buy a flat after 15 years (if we think in that direction).

so, now coming to other home option i have is to buy independent bungalows (or houses) which is costing me somewhere around 2.5-3cr.(i have some family wealth, and some loan and some my savings, so let's skip the financial aspect of purchasing).(also, lets skip the risk of buying independent, as that also i will get covered from lawyers)

thus, does it make sense for me to buy an independent house when i don't plan to stay in it in near future also, as gated societies would be where i would be spending at least next 15-20 years of my life.

i am asking this question is because of the psychological pressure of not having a home and staying in a rented home 10 years down the line when i will be having a family and kid(s).i am really confused, as one part of mind says if you don't have to stay in the independent house then why to buy it, you can always invest that amount and get crazy returns. then the other part of mind gets scared thinking of a life in bangalore in later stage of life living in rented home with no real physical asset of mine.

so, looking some help here friends, both in terms of finance and psychology if you can share your viewpoint. open to any discussion, if you give proper reason for purchasing society apartment even that i would be open to."

i used to watch memes and stuff on an app most people are unaware of but that was not all. i got myself in a group of dealing account, currency and many more things gods knows. and as you can imagine a totally online platform i got my ass scammed. i got filled with many feeling but the one i remembered correctly was """" wow """" yeah i know it feel weird after getting your ass scammed you didn't cry but was amazed

but after all this mess my mind was totally on different level than any other 15 year old kid. i got a moto in my mind people are fucking idiots they deserve what's comming for them. after continuously searching for 15 fucking days i got my first target. i used all i got all words i got and convinced him and later snapped everything from him. i was not in guilt but instead i got cold laughs

from then i started living my life in expenses buying everything i need even more than that and killing my own feelings by my own hand that was fun for me and throughout that time i learned 1 one which was very clear to me

____money is not a drug but is like alcohol it makes you more of what you are_____and believe me it got me wild. with me killing my emotion i started destroying peoples life with the way of talk i developed with time which is ""lying""

for example:-
you worked hard on something with love, money,time then i came fucked your mind with my words snapped everything from you and torture you. till you might suicide, well like hell i cared

things gone wild for me the amount of cursing, cries, bad mouthing increased for me till the point i got my ass popular in that group.by that time i already finished every emotions, sympathy i got in me. the only thing left was a lonely cold hearted. 

with time i got my self full. i didn't enjoyed doing dirty stuff but i got addicted to it as it became a part of my life that's not all i also got my friend involved in it. 

but the resolve to leave the past behind was high in my heart. i started socialising in my school and lucky i falled in love with a girl from my class
curly hair around 5.4, introvert type i thought but that was not correct. but i was no longer i got to know that those cursing worked. the things i touched always broked and got in worse condition. 

my secret kept revealing to people i never wanted to show this side of my life worst part of my life. i also got in self realisation about the things i have done before the words :- i will suicide please dont do it, i thought we were brother why are you doing this, please dont do it i eat all my medicine"" started making sense i cut myself from rest of the world. and thought of only one thing

the road towards station was jam packed, and i was desperately searching for a ride. since it was diwali night, very few were available. i found an old rickshaw driver, the one which is pedalled manually, hurrying off to his home. i stopped him, asked to drop me at railway station.

he saw his watch, time was running out. it seems he was supposed to attend a diwali party. i begged him, please.. drop me. will pay extra.

he refused the bribe, but accepted the ride. he told he will drop me in next 15 mins, and quite aggressively started off.

he honked his bell, shouted the folks walking on the road to get aside, and very diligently and full of determination, kept on paddling hard. 

suddenly, there came an unexpected pothole, and entire rickshaw shook and vibrated, and suddenly, one waistcoat and a small quarter of an expensive whiskey dropped down, first into my hands, and then into the road. it must have been hidden in some cavity in the top portion of the rickshaw, since alcohol is not allowed in haridwar.

the whiskey bottle instantly shattered on the road. the waistcoat i was able to hold. 

he abruptly stopped. looked down at the shattered pieces of the  bottle, and whiskey which gelled with the road and the dirt.

his eyes turned into stone it seems. his mouth uttered some high level expletives, and he resumed the ride. albeit, slow this time. 

worried about my train, i asked him, was this whiskey supposed to be consumed today at his diwali party?

with a dejected body language, he nodded. he told that this was his 1st whiskey in more than 6 months, a luxury for which he had saved money, and he didn't even open the seal.

he sighed, ""ganga maiya na kuch deti hai, na kuch leti hai. sab yehi reh jaata hai.."" (maa ganga doesn't give or take. everything stays here..)

as per the promise, we reached railway station, way before the time, and i got down. paid him the rickshaw fare as per the promise, and he started to move. directionless it seemed, because he was not sure, where he will go now. 

i stopped him, and extended a rs 500 note towards him. confused, he asked why?

for your diwali party, i told. go, buy another bottle. it's still early evening. 

a sudden smile erupted, and he saw that note for full 10 seconds, before accepting it, and putting it inside his pant. 

happy diwali bhaiya, sukhi raho, he blurted out. (happy diwali, stay blessed)

and then turned his rickshaw towards a known road.. his body language was now determined, and he had a destination. 

have bought some costly gifts during festivals, received as well, but trust me, the satisfaction and some strange positive energy i felt in my walk towards the train was something else.

someone, somewhere, must had an amazing diwali that night."

1. phenomenal digital payment ecosystem: i was blown away by how almost everyone was comfortable with upi payments. there’s just no need for carrying cash or wallet. 

2. road infrastructure: while i found many new roads and metro constructions sadly the conditions of roads in many places is still full of potholes. 

3. cleanliness: i found relatively cleaner roads as i travelled across the cities. this observation features in this list particularly due to my travel to indore and ujjain. i found both the places to be clean. 

4. expensive: it’s true but that i’m returning after 4 years and i can’t expect price to remain at 2018 levels. but i felt like 1000 is the new 100. eating outside has become so expensive. 

5. consumer options: be it food delivery, groceries or other domestic services. there is plethora of options available for the consumers to choose from.

6. comfort first: i felt that indians do not mind spending anymore if it means additional comfort. i found this to be to be more pronounced for people under 40. interacting with my friends i was surprised with how they were comfortable spending such a significant %age of their income on daily expenses. good for the economy. bad for personal finance.

so unless you're someone who can afford to lose out on internet for three to god knows how many days, stay away from jiofiber at all costs.

eta: raised a complaint in consumer court and jio appellate authority, will update this if it worked.

eta 1: it's fixed now. called them up in the morning and told them to cancel my connection, they told me engineer will come by 5pm and fix. now i'm not sure what worked exactly, but it's unlikely it was consumer court because things don't move that fast with them. so it was either appellate or the threat of cancellation, either way try both. thanks to everyone who helped."
reddit,2022-11-17 16:47:58,"experience with jio fiber after sales service so my internet went out randomly on 15th november, filed a complaint, engineer came on the same day. after doing absolutely nothing for 3 hours, they were just sitting in front of my house and using their phones, they are like come down we need to talk. 

i go downstairs and they're like the wire is cut, you have to take a new connection now, i told them that sounds absurd and as i just recharged i can't just let that go. only because they'll get more commission if they install a new connection. they argued for a bit and then proceeded to do nothing again for an hour and left saying there's no power in the pole so we'll come tomorrow.

surprise surprise they didn't come, and even today the same story. calling their customer service is absolutely useless as all they'll tell you is we'll fix it soon and the engineer will come. 

ask them to assign a new engineer? not possible.

reddit,2022-11-30 19:47:41,"i think we as a society don't talk enough about footpaths / sidewalks. like, i've seen a lot of people talk about condition of roads. they say that road is bulit of cheap/poor material, it is not smooth, has potholes, poor drainage system leading to water logging on roads / streets, how many roads government has built, speed limit on roads etc. but i never see people talking about foothpaths and sidewalks.

like, no one says that there is no sidewalk in this street or footpath on this road. no one mentions the quality of tiles used to make the footpath, dirt/dust on it, the encroachments / tree guards / electricity poles on the sidewalk, poorly built footpath, etc.

and people are so used to the lack of sidewalks! like, people don't even bother if there's no footpath on the street. it's as if people think that not having sidewalks is perfectly normal.

and what's most shocking is that i've often seen people walk on the road even if there is a footpath available. i mean, that's insane! like, why would you not use the footpath??? it keeps you safe from the traffic and you can walk tension free since people in india rarely drive on sidewalks (which is a shocking fact on its own i think). people just don't value footpaths!

also, a footpath is built on the ground and thus it hides the soil under it which in turn greatly reduces the amount of dust on the road. after making a sidewalk, the dust in the street is mostly brought by wind and other vehicles which can be regularly cleaned and managed without too much difficulty. but if there is no footpath, then the dust in the street is permanent and cannot be cleaned.

i think we should talk more about sidewalks, like how we talk about roads so that there is more pressure on government to improve it. 

also, we should talk more about zerbra crossings, dust and cleanliness. zebra crossing is a joke in india. i hate dust with a passion."
reddit,2022-12-05 01:43:00,"for all prospective students going abroad on loans: don't. it's no longer worth it. whether we admit it or not, everyone goes to the west to make more money. all the chatter about culture, pollution, potholes, missing family, visa, food, etc. is all secondary to this. otherwise, people would be immigrating to bhutan too.

so i'm presenting a purely financial argument here. run the exact nos. before making this decision. i'll give the example of usa:

* highest salaries in the world
* highest tuition fees and living costs in the world
* intl students are charged full sticker price, while citizens get a much lower price
* interest rates upwards of 12% since fed rate hike and you are risky borrowers with no credit history

if americans find it tough to repay their loans with lower tuition and 2-3% interest rates, imagine the burden on you when things are 180\* for you and you come from a much lower ppp country.

even if you get a high-paying job, it'll take you well over a decade to recoup your investment. it's legal servitude, since the workforce in the west is dwindling they need young indentured workers to toil hard and make money from them.

reddit,2022-12-08 19:11:16,"potholes in bangalore are making my wife sexually insecure and ruining my marriage me and my wife are trying for a child but due to my inability to maintain an erection (nervousness and anxiety) i got prescribed sildenafil by a licensed doctor.

the problem is that it works well throughout the day, but very rarely at night- which is when me and my wife are usually free to engage in intercourse.

i mention day because every time my car (old hatchback so suspension is bad) passes over a pothole, the stimulation from the vehicle induces an erection.

my wife has always been a jealous woman- she is a good person but has deep insecurities, despite my constant reassurance that i find her attractive. but since our workplaces are near by, we travel at the same time every day and night. she is also in the car with me during these troubling times.

at first, i could catch her glancing at my trousers through my side vision on a particularly bad stretch of road. but eventually, it built up to a point where she was looking at it for 5-10 minutes at a time.

eventually, she started questioning why i seemed to have an erection every time she glanced at my trousers but not in the bedroom. i tried explaining to her that it was the potholes and not her, but she seems to think i'm lying.

she eventually started crying every morning on our way to work. she now refuses to travel with me when i'm driving. she catches a seperate uber to and from work.

i thought of contacting the local mla in our neighbourhood to fix this- but how do i explain to him that the reason the potholes are causing me so much trouble is because they temporarily cure my erectile dysfunction?"

yeah, rahul gandhi is visiting. our city falls in the way of his yatra. (rajasthan)

let's have a look at last week. we're having 8-10 hours of power cut daily. the roads are being repaired, washed, cleaned. the divider trees are being watered and clean. lights, road lights are repaired, side roads and pavements repaired and cleaned.

all the local vendors (street vendors) removed for 2 days so that means no good outside food for me.

now, all these things i mentioned sounds really nice, right? 
yeah. these are the things that's supposed to happen regularly (periodically) by the authorities.

fun fact: the repairs are being done after months if not years, not for progress or as maintenance but only for promotion, boot-licking, to hide the reality and present a false development all for the sake of publicity and fame.

at this point i wish that such yatras are held every year for every city. atleast will have some development even if it means to suffer for weeks before and after.

edit: totally forgot to tell you people about all the city, district local (buses) transport and the trains. some of the trains are diverted while a lot of buses are cancelled or diverted to different routes. just think about the people who're daily commuters (not me) and how tough it must be for them."

one thing we learnt was that sunday is great from a traffic perspective but it is not ideal from a dosa perspective as everyone and their grandmas hit the dosa places all over town. so, the crowds are quite insane.

how i chose the places to eat at?

* places that we could get to without too much of a problem
* places near where i was staying – i moved between 3 areas of bangalore (hebbal, whitefield and indranagar)
* places i had not tried before and reddit recommendations

some places i couldn’t visit and regret:

* ctr: the crowds were just insane on a sunday morning

&amp;#x200b;

* sidappa: again, the crowds
* veena stores: annoying kannadiga uncle crowd. they were properly rude to us after cutting in line and then mouthing off at us in kannada.
* aruki kitchen (appears to be u/nahaamajai ‘s place): went there at 4:30pm on a thursday and was closed. [https://imgur.com/rvbdelh](https://imgur.com/rvbdelh)

the first dosa i had was right off the plane. to the right of arrivals, past the parking is a place called nandi upahar and the last dosa i had was 10 days later on the morning before i flew at a random place called udupi hub in whitefield. the most i did was 5 dosas on sunday.

how i ranked them?

* quality of the batter in terms of taste, crispiness/texture
* masala
* condiments: chutney/sambar (some places only provide chutney, others do both. so one combined rating)

so, without further ado, here are the rankings from this “trek”.

**10.** **janardhan hotel:** used to eat here many many years ago and since we were at racecourse road, we said why not. and what a disappointment. a shadow of what it once was

batter: looked bad. a weird ugly shade of brown. a bit on the sour side in taste. and no variation in texture. had an even thickness to it. 4/10

masala: small in quantity. and very bland in taste. just no. 2/10

condiments: sambar was decent – inoffensive. chutney was the white kind. not a bad taste but quite one-dimensional. just coconut with a hint of heat. nothing else. 4/10

&amp;#x200b;

**9. nandi upahar:** i landed early in the morning and immediately walked over to nandi upahar. it is to the right of arrivals, past the parking. anywhere else in the city, this is a slightly below average dosa. but being near the airport, means it is surprisingly good. food at the airport tends to be bad in general. 

batter: just a decent batter all around 6/10

masala: quite bland but did the job. no stand out flavours. 4/10

condiments: chutney was decently spicy. sambar was the typical sambar with a slightly sweet finish. 5/10

&amp;#x200b;

**8.** **udupi food hub:** wanted to grab one last dosa before i headed out to the airport. this place had good reviews and was nearby. so decided to pop over for a dosa.

batter: surprisingly decent. good crispiness and flavour. enough thicker bits that keep the texture interesting. 7/10

masala: another onion and potato masala. have had far better on this trip but this was inoffensive and not too bad. 5/10

condiments: a decent spicy sambar followed by a slightly watery green coconut chutney. the chutney was quite potent here – seemed to have a heavy garlic aftertaste along with some lingering spiciness. 6/10

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

**7. idc:** first time here. they like to put a podi on their masala. while it is a nice mix in textures, i hardly believe it works very well in terms of taste.

batter: not the best looking dosa. but has an even browning. not much variation in thickness and textures. 6.5/10

masala: the podi in the masala didn’t work for me but my cousin brother loved it. the masala itself is quite good. 7/10

condiments: not a huge fan of their sambar or their chutney. they both feel watered down in terms of flavours. nothing bold going on here. 5/10

&amp;#x200b;

**6. mulbagal dosa corner:** we decided to head to mulbagal and do the trek up to avani betta. the trek is a good 2 hours and is very relaxing with great views. after that we drove to mdc on the highway for lunch. the women in the group did not want to eat at the original and hardcore ones right in mulbagal town.

batter: now this was a unique dosa. like an appam and benne dosa had a bastard child. super thin and crisp edges. a crispy outside with a pillowy inside. super interesting textures as well. 9/10

masala: the podi and the masala worked better here. masala was sweet and spicy with lots of podi strewn over it. 7.5/10

condiments: the coconut chutney was the most basic of chutneys. tasted odd and generally quite bland in terms of spiciness. this is something you can expect to find at a north indian place not a south indian place. the red chutney was super spicy but did not really go that well with the dosa as a whole. 3.5/10

&amp;#x200b;

**5. rameshwaram café:** i really don’t get the hate for this place. yes, it is drenched in ghee. yes, it is over hyped. but in there, there are decent flavours. is it the best? no way. is it good? actually it is. we had this picked up and ate at home since the crowd was quite bad and home was just 5 minutes away.

batter: crispy with a slight overcooked feeling to it. drenched in ghee. the soft bits were quite delicious. a bit thin and crumbly in parts 7/10

masala: good flavours. nothing outstanding but above average. 6/10

condiments: sambar was quite decent. finish wasn’t too sweet. which is good. 2 types of chutneys, both are quite good and very similar in taste to each other, although one is a bit more minty. 7/10

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

**4. umesh dosa point/refreshments:** please note umesh dosa point has moved one street away and is now called umesh refreshments.

batter: another good looking dosa. had crunchy and soft bits so was a great textural adventure. tasted really good as well. 8/10

masala: oniony and mixed with a red chutney that had a nice garlicky kick to it. very enjoyable. am loving these oniony masalas btw. 8/10

condiments: the weak link here. while it was good. it didn’t match up to the rest of the dosa. felt like it was getting overpowered by everything else happening on the dosa. maybe that is a good thing for some but it didn’t work very well for me. 6/10

&amp;#x200b;

**3.** **#19 gully foods:** found this in bharatiya city. cousin swore by it. ordered the devenegere benne dosa. the amount of butter that goes in to one of these is bonkers. 

batter: soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. drenched in butter but so moreish, i couldn’t stop eating it on its own. 8/10

masala: looks bland but had quite a kick - really quite spicy. went well with the butter drenched dosa. 8/10

chutney: spicy with a killer kick to finish. perfect for such a thick and rich dosa. sambar was good. a bit watery but the chutney was the star here. 8.5/10

**2. bangalore thindies:** the other surprise in this list. i didn’t expect much since this was the 5th dosa of the day and i was getting dosa’d out.

batter: yes, another one of those textural wonders. thin and thick all in one dosa. a very nice tasting batter. 8.5/10

masala: very good. a bit more watery than i like but very good flavour – loved the stronger curry leaf flavour along with the chillies in it. 9/10

condiments: a good thick chutney that struck a very good balance between spicy, minty and coconuttiness. 8/10

**and the winner is.....**

**1. by2coffee:** after looking at the crowds at ctr, i remembered the wise words of u/necessarysilver. and boy was he right. this right here could be the hidden gem of dosas.

batter: great tasting. lovely mix of crisp and soft. love the spongy soft parts with huge holes in them – they were great for scooping up extra chutney. the dosa was a beautiful golden brown and looked like it belonged in an ad. 9/10

masala: lovely. with onions that provided a bit of sweetness to it. super flavourful. 8.5/10

chutney: one of the better chutneys i have eaten. spicy but with balance. the coconut flavour was not subdued here. just such a clean and balanced taste. 8.5/10

reddit,2023-01-18 20:18:46,"advice for first time visiting india hi everyone 
i will be traveling to india, my first time going there, in two weeks. took care of visa, purchased mosquito bracelets, went through a whole list of needed items. any advice so i don’t get sick with improper water or food? i am beyond excited but heard so many people saying to be careful so i would like advice of someone who’s been there multiple times. i am portuguese (not sure it will help to know background)


update: i appreciate all your comments and i have been through all of them! i will definitely tell you my opinion when i’m back! thank you for all the time you took to answer and advise me. 🙏🏽

update now that i am back in us: 
so i took all your advice recommendations and this is my experience: i didn’t really need odomos or mosquito bracelets. i forgot to use them most of the time and had no problem with it, so i’d say that was surprisingly great! first impressions of india as soon as i landed was the smell of the dirt but i was very happy about it tho. people are awesome, kind, always willing to help you and yes, they did look at me all the time and i even had people asking to take pictures with me (not sure why 🤣). i made sure yo only drink bottled water like i was told, but occasionally you’d visit someone’s house and they would come with tap water and i thought it to be rude to pass it so i drank it. luckily i was fine. i forgot to use bottled water to brush teeth but didnt encounter a problem. 
now when i left ahmedabad for agra that’s when the problems started. i was scammed left and right and i am embarrassed to admit it now. i should have known better. my husband says he was surprised i was so good at bargaining because i noticed we were constantly being asked for prices in dollars. if you’re a tourist and you think india is cheap think again!! we noticed everyone’s was always trying to get us a guide anywhere we would go and, we would accept but that came with a never ending process of taking us to shops to basically force you into purchasing things. i wish i knew better but by the time i realized that was a mo i had already spend a bit much.
taj was insanely gorgeous and so worth it. fatehpur sikri was one of my favorite places to visit actually. 
vrindavan ended up being chaotic. i had so many expectations for it i guess, but we were swamped left and right by beggars and was really really hard to move around. i had planned a whole day there but left after 1pm because you can’t really go anywhere without being harassed. at that point i was feeling a little disappointed already. it was hard for me as an individual wanting to pray and share time with the lord to be completely harassed and constantly being asked for donations. 
jaipur was stunning but the same thing happened. our driver got as a guide (don’t even know why since we never requested one in the first place ) and that guide showed us the amer fort but then took us into some shops where we spend easily 3 hours trying to get out of there and constantly saying we didn’t want anything but being constantly harassed. this is my one and only complaint about india. i know we’re all trying to make a living but it’s just so forceful that it’s almost impossible to detangle yourself from those money suckers. 

everything else i absolutely loved. the cows roaming in the middle of the street, the monkeys , the dogs, the peacocks. i was in awe with every single thing. i loved the rickshaw rides, how people were so friendly. if you keep yourself away from commerce places you’ll be fine, that’s my main take away 🤣

in which he says he cut down his portion size, controlled his hunger and that's how he lost 45 kg. but the truth is in 2011 he had a bariatric/weight loss surgery which he himself admitted. the problem is we indians have short memory. i am also sharing links of his 2019 interview, 2011 interview in which he praised bariatric surgery. he also thanked adnan sami in 2011 saying he suggested him the path of bariatric surgery. although adnan sami has repeatedly denied a weight loss surgery, but doctor say many vip lie about their surgery. 

many extremely obsese people (bmi &gt; 45 or weight of 150 kg) will get charged up but fail to loose weight or if they reach bmi of 25, might find hard to maintain it (like anant ambani). lot of times more than eating habits, extreme obesity is due to poor metabolism and genetics. instead vip (like gadkari) should talk about his surgery like he did in 2011 for people to think of it as an option. 

 i was reading in an american medical journal, which surveyed patients over years and put number only 1 in 1200 something people can reach bmi of 25-30 from 45+ and maintain it for long term. 

not a political post, just feel disappointed even the people who admitted of having it in past, start to lie after 10 years. i know people in india nose and judge, but why hide something which you admitted in past.

everything has to be about them all the time. 

they think that their problems are problems and mine are bulshit made up in mind.

i may have shortcomings too, but they always rub that in my face to the point that i don't feel like working on it anymore. 

when working on a deadline, they forget food or even drinking water, if i do that, i am a sore loser bcz i cannot take out time to even eat with them. 

if i have to wake up late into the night to complete some work, they will get insecure and start complaining that while i cannot wake up late to be with them (they have a habit to sleep by 3-4 am) i can wake up late to finish work.

they usually get offended on the slightest of things either by me or my friends or even my side of the family and then create havock on that. because i should have scolded the said family member and i do not love them if i did not. if it is me, then i should do all sorts of tantrums to make sure that i am feeling sorry for my so called mistake.

reddit,2023-02-19 07:28:12,"emigrating to the eu-some warnings i see a pro-emigration threads all the time which wittingly or unwittingly gloss over the potential issues that you might face moving abroad and to the eu especially. while the planned cities, clean air and water and the rich culture and natural beauty are truly sights to behold, i thought it would also help to give a view of some of the drawbacks you might encounter to help you make a more informed decision.

first and foremost, the eu is extremely diverse and almost a mini india in the sense that cultures and topographies change very drastically from country to country and therefore making  large scale generalisations about the eu as a whole is very difficult. lastly, these are all issues that i've observed or encountered first hand and purely based on my experiences in certain countries. ymmv.

the issues listed might not be true in every country but they are certainly true in some of the most developed eu countries as well(read france, germany, switzerland, etc). secondly, it isn't necessary that you will encounter all the issues listed in a particular country and some countries might have 1-2 issues while others have 4-5.

1. **xenophobia**: most europeans are xenophobic despite their vehement attempts to claim otherwise. a huge part of that has to do with the historical significance of europe in the past and it's relative decline over the last few decades and the increased immigration into europe from african and asian countries. sweden, germany, italy, france  among many other countries have massive issues integrating their immigrants and this is further increasing tensions between citizens and immigrants with no solution in sight. you see this to a lesser extent with younger europeans as well and you might have difficulties making friends with them unless you're an easily outgoing person.
2. **bureaucracy:** sometimes, bureaucracy in countries in the eu would make indian bureaucracy look like a breeze. especially countries like italy, germany have hair-tearing bureaucratic procedures. you thought your local office government employee or your sbi employee was a pain in the ass? imagine dealing with even more unhelpful employees with documentation entirely in foreign languages(looking at you italy). dealing with the unfriendly immigration authorities in italy is a half day exercise at the very least even for a task as simple as collecting your residence permit.  all while they treat you like dirt.
3. **language:** while you might just get by with english, in order to truly assimilate and fit into life in europe, you need to learn the local language fluently to a conversational level. even then there's no guarantee you'll feel like you belong because of the xenophobia. but knowing the language is undoubtedly a massive boost. most jobs in eu outside of the uk require the local language because conversations in the offices generally happen in the local language and not english. if you're going to the eu to study, be fully prepared to learn the local language to a fluent level to maximize your chances of landing a job. honorary exceptions include the uk and the scandinavian countries and to an extent, germany.
4. **taxes**: taxes everywhere. almost 40% of your income will be taxed in most of western europe. your taxes are certainly being put to decent use though, considering the robust state pension system, decent healthcare options and good educational facilities. however,  if your priority is wealth accumulation, you're in the wrong continent and the us(or arguably switzerland) is any day better. it's certainly more advantageous to have a life in eu as a family than as a single person due to the generous tax incentives they provide to families. additionally, with an ageing population and no replacements in the workforce, countries are increasingly struggling with their pension systems and are trying to increase the age of retirement to counter this and with no solution in sight, there is no guarantee you will receive pension once you turn 60.
5. **archaic technology:** in some countries, it certainly feels like they never left the 2000s. in italy for my bank at least, i  need to go to the bank home branch office and ask the employee to download a bank account statement if i want an account statement for a specific time period outside of the quarterly account statements that the bank sends to you digitally. in india and even in the uk, you can get this on your phone banking app.  in germany, my university required me to fill in the forms they sent, take physical print outs, then sign them manually, and then reupload them and send it back to them.
6. **housing crisis:** there is a massive housing crisis in most of the established big cities across europe. london, paris, amsterdam, barcelona, milan are all going through massive housing crisis and it's extremely difficult to get affordable housing in these cities, especially if you're a broke university student. post the pandemic, landlords have increased their prices seeing the increased demand for housing and the entire market is bonkers right now. then you have countries like luxembourg, where the housing system is fundamentally broken and you might need to hand over almost  3000-3500 euros at the very start to even move into a modest one bedroom apartment. with the increase in energy prices, the situation has gotten even worse unfortunately.
7. **indian food:** you will realize the value of the local tiffin centre/bandi where you could have lip smacking assortment of breakfast items for 50 rs. you will miss the roadside dabba wallas whose 80 rs lunch would be delicious and filling at the same time. try having dough based croissants or other breads or milk and cereal for breakfast every day because that's breakfast 90% of the time in most of western eu. you'll grow even fonder of your gulab jamuns and rasgullas once you realize they aren't a stone's throw away from the nearest mithai shop. good luck getting used to the bland food after having indian food all your life.

another issue usually pointed out is the lack of low priced services(maids, drivers, etc) but that has more to do with the lack of value for those jobs in india and is not particularly a eu problem and hence i chose to ignore it. however its an important  factor if you have elderly folks to take care of or you cannot manage the household work yourself."

reddit,2023-02-28 17:27:02,"trying to escape home and leave the country legally, but we need help hello, i'm sorry if this story is a little complicated, but i really need help with this. long story short, a friend of mine is trying to escape an abusive family with my help, but we're struggling with the legal side of it.

i am an italian citizen and she is indian citizen. her parents are very abusive, they hit her, scream at her and then gaslight her constantly, but fortunately she is turning 18 very soon.

our plan is simple: get a passport, get a visa, get her to italy and then get married, this way her parents wont have power over her anymore and we can stay together.

the problem is in the execution. because she is becoming 18, her passport will become invalid and will have to be renewed, and for a passport renewal in india, a policeman comes check on you at your house.

the other problem is that one month after she becomes 18, her parents are probably going to cut her internet completely and therefore our communications. we know they plan on doing this because her parents have already declared they will do this.

this leaves some options:

1. sneakily get the passport, this option is likely to fail due to the check on her house
2. attempt to trick her parents into getting a passport for her, this is possible because her parents like to travel and have to take her with them, so proposing a vacation might convince them to make the passport, but we're not sure
3. run away from home as soon as possible. this option is more reliable has i have a very good salary (i'm 20 and work as a software engineer, lucky) and could send her the money to survive for a bit, but there are a couple of problems. first problem is that i've read stories about indians trying to escape their house even as adults, and the police consistently broke the law and forcefully brought them back to their parents, to avoid this problem the plan is to get a lawyer so that when her parents file a missing person report and the police find her, she can say she is an adult and she wants her lawyer there, possibly stopping the policemen from doing anything illegal. the second problem is that of getting the passport, so she will need a new residence, and a bank account to receive the money from me. the bank account requires a residence, and the residence requires a bank account. also following this plan, it will take a long while before she can get the passport, leaving space for her parents to go full psycho.

i don't know enough about indian laws and possible procedures to make this easier, we need help, she probably can't mentally survive in that household much longer."

reddit,2023-03-06 17:03:40,"ever wonder why india rarely has a rated movies, while in the west its more commonplace? i recently went down a journey to discover india’s a rated cinema, movies that were deemed to be suitable for adults audiences only. the indian film industry isn’t known for its a rated films. in fact, **less than 1 in 5 films** rated a releases every year in india and these figures are from 2016. the number has gone down further since. figures for the same for the us have also fallen but still remain much higher than that of india.

so why is this the case?

**there are 2 reasons- cbfc and the indian rating system**

# reason 1: central board of film certification or popularly known as the “censor board”

as i continued to travel along my journey, i noticed something strange. the fact that even after the a rating, the film had **bleeped out curses**. moreover, after checking the imdb runtime of these films, i realized that **some entire scenes were cut out altogether**. if the film already had a mature content rating, **why were these additional steps taken?**

here i was thinking that **cbfc**, like the **mpaa of usa**, **just classifies and certifies the movies** and **does not** actually censor/remove anything. but as i could see very clearly, this was not the case. (i also realized that the abbreviation ""cbfc'' does not actually contain the words ""censor board"". i genuinely thought that cbfc stood for censor board).

turns out cbfc actually has the same job as the mpaa but unlike mpaa, **cbfc holds the power to stop a film from releasing altogether**. this was not the case until one particular case in 1970, **k.a. abbas versus union of india** , where abbas had made a documentary film, **a tale of four cities (1968)**, which was granted an “a” certificate for viewing only by adults. he challenged the **cinematograph act** as he wanted his film to be viewed by all. the **chief justice hidayatullah** upheld the law on the ground that **films had an “instant appeal**” and could **“stir up emotions more deeply than any other product of art”**. 

from here on out, cbfc got the **power to stop films from releasing** until it was **censored** to meet the standards of the board on what they thought **was good for the general public**. cbfc’s own data shows that a **greater proportion of feature films** are being **passed with cuts** in recent times. about a decade ago, **two out of every three** indian movies were certified without any cuts; now, that has fallen to **one in every two**.

**here is where the trouble of indian directors and writers begin.**

i think most people know most of the rest of the story. but here is how the process started to go for a film to get certified and released in india:

1. **send a copy of the film to cbfc**
2. **cbfc views it and decides on one of the three things- gives a u rating, gives a u/ a rating with suggested cuts, or gives an a rating with list of required cuts.**
3. **once a film has been given either of the three ratings, there is no way a film could go from a to u/ a or u/ a to u. the certification is permanent. so for a filmmaker who has received an a rating, they have to do the required cuts for the film to be released. or they can go to the court and contest cbfc's decision. (more on this below)**
4. **the film finally gets released if the filmmaker does the required cuts or it gets lost in the limbo forever cause cbfc's decision also applies to all physical media.**

the final point is less damning now since ott platforms do not come under cbfc jurisdiction so filmmakers can go direct to streaming, but before the streaming era this is what actually happened to multiple filmmakers. most famous example- **paanch (2003)**.

if a filmmaker goes to court to contest the cbfc decision, they are **bound to wait at least a year** before the court makes a decision. this is not feasible for most production houses due to **monetary concerns** so all they can really do is **edit the film as requested** because the other option is dealing with the indian legal system and most prefer not to do that. there are some filmmakers who have done this and the results they received were not appealing for other people to go and follow. for example, movies like **black friday (2004)** and **udta punjab (2016**) while the latter example had the benefit of being in a digital age and receiving support from the general public, kashyap's black friday was **blocked for release for 2 years** while the production house battled in court for its release.

and after all this, reception by the public of said films **remains lukewarm** at best due to lack of promotion. here too cbfc plays a role. while content shown on television (normal cable tv) does not come under cbfc, **the promos and advertisements that are showcased do**. so here again we see **stringent censorship** that often blocks or limits promotion of a rated films.

# reason 2: indian rating system

**audience ratings is a fairly new thing in india**. before **imdb** was popularized in india (and used by tv shows for promotion), there were only **two metrics** by which a person could know whether or not a film was worth watching- **what critics thought of the film** and **whether it was a box office hit or a flop.**

the latter played (and continues to play) a **vital role** in swaying a person. **“movie hit thi ya flop?”** (was the movie hit or flop)  is a common phrase used by several of us when deciding whether or not we should see this film. **if the movie gains money at the box office, it’s a hit. if not it’s a flop**. box office is everything that matters for everyone- audiences, production houses and critics. and herein lies **another reason why a rated films are so rare**.

on average, **a rated films earn way less than a u or u /a rated film**. this is true everywhere but its force is more immensely felt in india. **films that are loved by audiences and critics but fail to gain money at the box office are labeled flop and that title remains with it for the rest of life.** 

**so how does all this lead to the current state of indian cinema?** production houses became increasingly risk proof. they started giving money to safe films, films that were guaranteed to be certified and released by cbfc and that were controversy free. this gives us the infamous term ""masala movies"". **pick out any a-list actor, get about-competent screenwriters to write a script, get a director to make a film that looked similar to every other similar film released in the past decade and voila, you have a hit on your hands**. we started seeing such movies everywhere and films that were riskier and tackled mature content became almost extinct for a while. add into this the **inherently nepotistic industry** and **a fundamentally flawed rating system** and we are left with the current state of indian cinema. **a constant stream of mediocre content using the same old storylines that 90s love stories used.** oh and the monthly biopics (dont forget about that, industry just loves them).

are there any signs of change? well ott platforms seem to be taking a few risks and with the rising popularity of rating aggregators people are starting to see what the general consensus of the above talked films are like. but overall reform still seems very far and doesn’t seem likely to change anytime in near future.

hi,

my dog accidently scratched using her nails near my toe region and very little amount of blood oozed out. i immediately cleaned it with an anti-sceptic and water.

my dog is a female lab that has not been bitten or come in close contact with any other dogs for a while and before she scratched me. she's got all her shots before this on time and i'm really panicking right now since i cannot vaccinate myself immediately (not before saturday) and it's already been a week and a half since the incident.
my sister also told the vet that she did this and the vet told don't worry it's not a problem.

reddit,2023-03-17 13:01:06,"seeing all these power outage complaints so figured i'd give a perspective seeing the large number of power outage complaints and the abuse towards bescom so figured i'd give a perspective  since i've lived in bangalore long enough and experienced this each year and hopefully it reduces the whining on this group .

as y'all know we live in a very pretty city with a large number of trees , which is partly responsible for the beautiful shade and pleasant weather that you get that all of y'all love to talk about as the great thing about this city .

now sadly the flip side of this is that the trees are close to the power lines and when it rains and it gets a little windy , debris from the trees fall on the power wires and causes it to short which cause the power outage .

now coming to bescom , the bescom engineers cannot really fix most of the issues till the rain stops which is why the delay . but at most times bescom is at the location of the outage as soon as the rain stops to fix the issue.

i lived in different parts of the town over the years and every time there is an outage they are here as soon as possible in the middle of the night trying to fix the issue . understand that bescom helplines will be understaffed to handle the high volume of complaints that come in at this time cause 1. it happens mostly late evening and night and 2. everyone from your neighborhood is already calling bescom so chances are your call might not get thru

what's the solutions to this - trimming and cutting the trees , but that isn't a solution is it . 

not saying your complaints aren't valid but a little bit of empathy is required . the city has it flaws but its also a great place that we love and has changed most of our lives .

in other words swalpa adjust maadi.

reddit,2023-04-08 21:35:19,"learning to drive hi guys, so as the title says, i'm learning to drive dad's car, a 2013 hyundai i10 in kolkata. i'm 20 days in, and i've learnt most of the technical aspects of driving and can drive reasonably decently on a straight, smooth road with minimal traffic. however i face the following problems. some of these are general in nature, some pertain specifically to indian conditions.

i panic when other vehicles honk relentlessly. especially at a signal. i jam the car into first gear, with an intention of slowly rolling forward, but the second the signal turns green, everyone honks, and i panic and in my panic i am very likely to let the clutch go too quickly, stalling the engine and therefore blocking the lane and making everything exponentially worse.

i am terrible at dealing with bumpers. i come way too close to the bumper when i brake suddenly to avoid crossing it too fast, putting me at risk of collision from behind. i am unable to estimate exactly how much i ought to press my clutch pedal to move over the bumper at a controlled speed, and either end up stalling my engine or crossing it waay too fast.

i am unable to fluidly shift gears in several situations. i can do so decently when accelerating on a straight road, but i often forget to shift downwards when i must suddenly decelerate, for example when a cycle comes in front of me out of nowhere or the car enters a massive pothole/bumper. 

i am bad at dealing with sharp bends. i overestimate/underestimate precisely how much i have to turn, and in kolkata's dead narrow, sharp af bends, i often end up hitting my rear view of walls and stuff. 
i often go at a snail slow pace in bends, and end up blocking the roads for other cars. 

in the same line, i am terrible at swerving in sudden situations. when a dumb pedestrian/dog/cycle/bike comes in front of me, i am bad at estimating how much to swerve and end up hitting something in the opposite direction.

i am also very bad with u turns, and end up doing them very slowly and block other cars. 

another thing that i find very hard is dealing with slightly sloping surfaces. unless i press the accelerator much, the car rolls backward or the engine stops (note that i also forget to shift to a lower gear), and when i do press the accelerator, it often goes out of control.

i panic in general in tough situations, and even in situations not too tough for a decent driver. if i look in the rear view mirror and see a truck thundering towards me, i panic. if there is a fucking ricksha in front of me at the time, i panic even more. if i am driving on, say, a road with a bazaar on the sides, i panic. if i am in a narrow lane and see a vehicle coming in the opposite direction, i panic. any of these situations requires you to calmly negotiate your circumstances  but i simply shut down completely and make the dumbest mistakes. 

i often forget to use my horn and that lands me in bad situations especially in sharp bends where you can't see the other side.

whenever i focus particularly on getting any of these specific things correct, i forget and mess up basic things. most of these things i know what to do on a technical level, but the problems are in my head. i either forget, or am unable to estimate things or i panic. often driving feels like too many things to handle and keep track of at the same time. 
how do i get over these problems and become confident quickly?"
reddit,2023-04-14 14:48:08,"worried about the situation in punjab, sikhs, and india hello everyone,

what has been happening recently in the country and abroad is making me very anxious. the gap between hindus and sikhs seems to be getting wider every day. syncretism, which was a big part of punjabi culture is fading away. people are becoming extremists in all religions. separatism seems to be growing as well. there is a lack of leadership among sikhs which can address the problems within and outside the religion. this leads to extremists taking hold. there's also hindu extremism across india. both of these feed into each other. i think the present circumstances are going to be especially bad for the sikhs since we are a tiny minority. we already have previous wounds which are unaddressed. there's anger and hurt in people. i've also heard punjab will suffer water shortage in the next few years. idk how long people in this region of the world have to suffer. invasions, partition, wars, and genocide. we never seem to get a break.

it looks like the ""liberal"" values of india have completely been wiped away. secularism, which means separation of religion and state, has become a bad world. there's very little awareness on basic human rights, tolerance of difference of opinion, and respect for other's freedoms. many people seem to be forcing others to chant their religious slogans, and want a theocracy. needless to say, this makes many minority groups doubt their status in the country and whether or not they are seen as equals. all of this is seems so foreign and not relatable. one can work on material things like poverty, unemployment, economy, education, even women empowerment, etc. but one cannot do anything if the people themselves are tribalistic and have toxic mentality; if the system refuses to arrest criminals and if the criminals have mass support.

all of this weights heavy on my mind and i feel very down at times. i just need a place to share how i feel about all this. sometimes i get severe anxiety thinking about how much loss of life, destruction of cultural values, and harmony has happened and continues to happen. it's got to point it is affecting my mental health on some days.

regarding the problem specific to the society i live in there is water shortage, ofcourse it's a great deal for the same reasons we all use water for, hence the society decided to take tankers for the extremity of the situation, we all are required to pay a certain amount for it (included in maintenance money), on a good day there's 2 tankers worth of water is provided.
now the problem which occurred is between both the buildings 
is wing 1 is given more water in comparison to wing 2 reasons given.wing 1 a politician of renowned party (a party worker) resides and from a previously assumed situation he has gained power over chaukidar (watchman) who has the responsibility of valves and water supply for both the building...
since no one could work on the basis of assumption and without any proof, such assumptions were mostly dismissed but the recent situation clearly shows some misconduct
this was understood after a conversation with a person in wing 1 who said that the water supply was atleast 18-20 hours and in the wing 2 water supply is just 2 hour.
we all pay the same amount, why does something like water would be disputed over then?
when the chaukidar was asked,he claimed that the water is equally distributed and when he got to know about who had given us the information of them getting water for 18-20 hours he approached them and told them to not say that the water is being provided for so long
this is nothing but classic case of money and muscle power
and it can be clearly said so
if the payment of water supply is the same then one must receive equal amount of water..."

reddit,2023-05-06 17:18:41,"the kerala story, the rss and the hindu psyche the kerala story has put the spotlight on isis recruits from india. it started by claiming that about 32000 malayalee women joined isis. (it has been reduced to 3 after a lot of push back) .the fact that official figures put the number of isis recruits from all over india at about 70 didn't stop them from making this outlandish claim.  while it is true that about half of them were from kerala, it can easily be explained by the fact that most of the recruits worked in the middle east. the number of people who joined isil from all over south-east asia( about 40% of muslims live here) - indonesia (800), maldives(200), malaysia (154), pakistan (100), india(70), bangladesh(40), sri lanka(32), is in total less than that of europe. just from germany, france and the uk, about 3000 people joined isil. from russia alone, there are 5000, the highest from any single country.

the overt propagandist aim of the movie and the intent of its makers is to create a perception that there is a high level of islamic radicalisation in india, especially in kerala. the intent of the makers is clear, to alienate and dehumanise indian muslims, to make any expression of their religion be perceived as a threat to the larger hindu population.  in line with most propagandist institutions of the post-internet era, the tactic is to slowly poison the average hindu mind and assuage it to discrimination and violence against muslims and their allies.

the movie, kerala story, is not made for the malayalees but is targeted at the north indian hindus. they want to demonise kerala, a religiously diverse state whose existence contradicts the basic premise of the rss, the hindu-muslim enmity and muslim radicalisation.  for the rss kerala is an embarrassment that questions the very need for their existence. demonising kerala achieves two purposes, one to discredit the success of kerala, and two to concoct an ongoing example of the imminent threat of islamist takeover of hindus - ""it's happening right next door, it's only a matter of time"". this coordinated assault on kerala is evident from the remarks made by top bjp leaders like amit shah, yogi and most recently the one who is afraid of questions.

the rss needs to convince the average hindu that no muslim is a good muslim and that any society with a sizable population of free muslims expressing their identity is a threat to hindu existence. this allows them to sell the solution they provide, the subjugation of indian democracy under a hindu theocratic ideology. a good muslim, by implication a subjugated muslim.  bougies like ""love jihad"" is aimed to trigger the ego of the primitive male-dominated society like that of the hindus\* with a threat to their most prized possession, women.  i would like to quote a few lines of arjun from the bhagavat githa for the more devout hindus

*""by the prevalence of impiety, o krishna,*

*the women of the family become corrupt. women*

*corrupted, there will be intermingling of castes""*

the rss agenda is to influence the moderate social psyche of the average indian hindu, especially the hindu middle class, by using the muslims as a scapegoat and to consolidate their power by destroying any modernist-rational-liberal institutions or cultural  centres in india that might stand against them. the average 'educated' middle-class hindu, especially many of the young ones(the future) who are woefully ignorant of world history, the ideas of democracy and liberalism outside of what little is found in school textbooks, culturally transmitted perceptions and in the post-internet era, youtube-instagram 'educators' that tell you the 'real truths', are especially susceptible to this. the fact that indian education at all levels, from small schools to premier institutions like the iits is terrible at cultivating intellectual independence doesn't help.

the work of the rss is made easy by the fact that the indian hindu mind is a unique combination of a severe lack of self-esteem and a disproportionately large ego. the rss, therefore, spends a good amount of resources being pimps that sell ""pride-whores""(other than white youtubers) to indians desperately in need of validation. this is especially effective on upper castes and wanna-be honorary kshatriya - shudra/obcs.  the idea of ram rajya is itself a romanticised fantasy reconstruction of some glorious past of the superior hindu civilisation (trivia: humans have been doing this since the beginning of civilisation). the reclaiming of this glory, the indian hindus believe, will somehow remedy their lack of self-esteem and justify their ego and deliver the hindu from the decadence of modern islamo-western cultural influence and to 'true' independence.

&amp;#x200b;

the entire ideological basis of the indian right wing is built on such pettiness that it looks laughable and embarrassing from the outside. at this point, i can't help but point out the irony that the ideology of the rss (sarvarkar's and golwalkar's ) is a copy of the cultural nationalism of the west ( an ideology of racist pre-liberal europe) and their approach to post-caste theocratic socio-political organisation is a copy of the theocratic power structure of abrahamic religions(which they hate).

the problem persists mostly because the uc hindus can't take an honest look at themselves as they fear what they might find might destroy any semblance of self-esteem they have. hell, it's not even that they don't know, but the level of denial is so deep it's near impossible to drag them out of it. if india was a person you could have sent it to therapy but instead we are stuck with letting it cut itself in some sick fit to forget its problems and slowly bleed to itself to death.

&amp;#x200b;

ps: \*i am not claiming that muslim society isn't male-dominated or patriarchal. the muslim community has their issues but for all practical purposes, the victims are muslims themselves. even in the extremely unlikely event of a  cataclysmic spiral of the muslim community(14%) into complete radicalisation, it's not something the indian state can't handle. but the same cannot be said of hindus that are about 50-80 % of the indian population.

brothers and sisters, friends and i don't see the children who sang but, where are they, yeah i'd like to welcome all of you and thank all of you for coming here and also thank the wonderful children for the song they sang it was sung very movingly and very well.

some months ago, we started a walk from kanyakumari to kashmir. prior to walking, we were finding that the normal tools that we used to use for politics, conversations like this public meetings was simply not working anymore. all the instruments that we needed to do politics in india - they were controlled by the bjp and the rss. you know people are threatened, this is (important?) people, agencies are used on people. so, we were also finding that in some way it had become quite difficult to act politically and that's why we decided to walk from southernmost tip of india to srinagar. 

when we started, i thought okay. after five or six days, we realized that actually walking four thousand kilometers is not an easy thing you know and and i had an old knee injury that started to act-up. so i said now i’m in real trouble because there's no choice - one has to walk and i'm having quite a lot of pain then quite a surprising thing happened just i started noticing that after walking 25 kilometers - 25 kilometers is more than half a marathon - after walking three weeks every day 25 kilometers i suddenly felt one afternoon that it's strange that i'm not feeling tired at all. i get up in the morning six o'clock - we used to start and we used to end walking at about 7.30-8 in the evening. i was like, this is very strange - i'm not feeling tired at all, what is this? then i started asking people around if they are feeling tired, everybody is saying it's very strange that they're not feeling tired as well. 

so i started to think about it and i realized that actually what was going on was that it was not us who were walking, it was india that was walking with us, right, and the large mass of people who are coming from all religions, all communities, everybody, kids - they were creating an atmosphere of love and affection where nobody was feeling tired. almost as if, everybody was walking together, helping each other, and that's where we came up with the idea - nafrat ke bazaar mein mohabbat ki dukaan kholi (*we opened a shop of love amidst the market of hate*).

[commotion in the back of the conference]

see, the interesting thing about us, about the congress party, is we have affection towards everybody - if someone wants to come, and say something - regardless of what they're saying, we're happy to listen to it. we are not going to get angry, we're not going to get aggressive, we'll nicely listen to it. in fact, we'll be affectionate to them we'll be loving to them because that's our nature.

so, we found that when everybody started walking together - completely different type of energy started coming and i noticed that the government tried everything. [*i mean, they tried all their might in stopping the yatra. they used police - but it didn't work - but the effect of yatra was constantly rising. why it happened was because you all helped us.*] not only in india, bharat jodo is an idea that is in all your hearts. and, it is about respecting each other and being affectionate to each other, it is about being not being violent towards each other, not being arrogant. i can see my sikh brothers here. your guru nanakji - his entire life was about this only. that, be humble, right, be humble, be affectionate and we walked nothing compared to guru nanakji. i read somewhere that guru nanakji had gone all the way to mecca, saudi arabia, he had gone to thailand, he head gone to sri lanka. so, these giants were doing bharat jodo much before we were born, right? and i can say the same for my friends from karnataka - basavanaji, friends from kerala - narayana guruji. 

yeah so every state in india has had these giants everywhere. i mean and every single one of them said listen to each other, be respectful - not just of your own religion, not just of your own language, not just of your own culture - but be respectful towards all cultures, all religions, all languages because they are in fact the same. and, the assault that is taking place in india - it's taking place on our way of life. sam petrodaji said that he grew up with all people living happily - different languages, different religions and that is what is being attacked. also, the tradition in india and again something like gurunanakji, basavanaji, gandhiji emphasized that not to be under the impression that you know everything that the world is too big too complicated for any one person to think that he understands everything and he knows everything. and so really that is the disease that sam outlined that that is the disease that we have a group of people in india who are absolutely convinced that they know everything. in fact i think they think maybe they know even more than god. they could they could sit down with god and have a conversation and explain to him you know about what is going on and of course our prime minister is one such specimen. 

[applause]

i think i think if you if you sat modiji down next to god modiji would start explaining to god how the universe works. and, god would get confused that what have i created. so these are these are funny things but but really this is what is going on we have a group of people you know who understand everything. they can speak to scientists and explain science to them. they can you know speak to historians and explain history to them. they can explain warfare to the army and flying to the air force. whatever they want, they can you know and at the heart of it is mediocrity. that they actually don't understand anything because because in life you cannot understand anything if you are not ready to listen. that's something the biggest - lesson i learned from bharat jodo yatra that there is something to learn from everybody. we are much older than those children but i can guarantee you they can teach us all how to sing. i was looking at them and i was thinking you know i can't sing like that. it's impossible, so when you look at another person, you have to appreciate that they have an experience, they have a life, they have seen things and maybe you can learn a lot from them. maybe if you open your ears, you will listen to them and learn from them. and that is actually the indian tradition. if you look if you look at our country, you will find that our country has the ability to absorb any idea that comes. india has never rejected any idea. everybody who has come to india - has been received with open arms and their ideas have been absorbed in india. and that is the india that we like - india that respects the rest of the world, india that is humble, india that listens, india that is affectionate. 

and that is the india that you represent. you would not be here if you do not if you did not agree with these values. if you if you believed in anger, hatred, arrogance - you'd be sitting in a bjp meeting. and, i would be doing mann ki baat.

[applause]

thank you very much for holding up the indian flag in america. showing the american people, what it means to be indian, respecting them, respecting their culture, learning from them and also allowing them to learn from you. you make us all proud. and, when we think of our country, you're all our ambassadors. when america says indian people are extremely intelligent, indian people or masters of it, indian people are respectful - all these ideas that have come, they've come because of you and because of your actions and your behaviors. so i thank you very much for that.

i came here this morning, sam organized the flight - i arrived after 16 hours of flying - 6.30 in the morning - i thought i'd be tired but i'm not tired at all because of the energy that you have given me. thank you.

[after a break]

they've asked me to answer your questions. see that that also would not happen in a bjp meeting.


**question 1** - so i would like to ask you two questions - regarding this woman bill that has been uh you know in the court for almost more than half a century, so when the congress comes in power - bill about woman's reservation rights - so that bill has been there for more than a quarter century. so as a congress leader,  what are your thoughts on it and how are you gonna deal with it? that's my first question. the second question is - in india, it's very hard for a woman - as a safety issue - so what are we going to you know offer our next generation of the girls in india. thank you.

**rahul gandhi** - so on the women's reservation bill - we are committed to that. we wanted to pass it in the last government but some of our allies were not too happy with it and they didn't give us the support for that bill. but i'm confident when we come to power we'll pass that bill. i think part of the answer to your second question lies in the first question itself. if we empower women, if we involve women in the political system, if we give women space in the governance of the country, if we give women space in the businesses of the country, we will automatically make them safer. so i think involving them in politics, involving them in business, involving them in running the country are the way to give them power. thank you. 

**question 2** - hello rahul ji, my name is pugal. i'm the president of indo-american society for science, reason and free-thought. i also represent tamils who live in bay area. on behalf of our people and on behalf of people who believe in science, reason and free-thought, i would like to point out the we are honored, humbled and most truly, proud of your journey about opening up the shops of love on the streets of hate all over the india. tamils have long tradition of harboring brotherhood mindset throughout their civilization - three thousand years ago our forefathers said

[speaks in tamil]

[applause]

translation - all human beings are created equal and every town is our town, everybody is our relative. 

to us, india is like european union with each state having its own language, its own tradition, its own festivals, its own cuisine, dress code, way of living etc etc. they are all different, yet we live under one country called india therefore it is deeply saddening to us when someone from the union government try to impose one language one culture, one tradition, one religion, one school etc. recognizing this diversity to make a robust country, our beloved leader - the dravidian icon former chief minister proclaimed, both in parliament and in public forums, [speaks in tamil] which means autonomous rule at the state level and federal rule at the union level.

dear rahulji, you have studied in america and you have traveled within united states extensively and you know much better than anyone else in this room that america is the best example of federalism. each state has its own constitution. it's one supreme court apart from federal laws. whereas in india, congress party did have its own share of problems in the past but the times have changed the new thinking has emerged and you are the epitome of the new thinking. you are they new hope and the streets of hate in india - my question to you is that like united states of america what's your thought on making india as a true united states of india. thank you[applause]

**rahul gandhi** - if you read our constitution, the definition of india in the constitution is a union of states and within our constitution is the idea that the languages, cultures, histories of each one of our states has to be protected under the union. so what you're talking about, is already incorporated in our constitution, it's already there. the bjp and the rss are attacking that idea that you mentioned and also the constitution of india. that is fact now. for me personally, i understand that the tamil language is more than a language to tamil people, right? it is not just a language, it is their history, it is their culture, it is their way of life and i will never ever allow tamil language to be threatened. [applause] 

threatening the tamil language is to threaten the idea of india just like threatening bengali or threatening kannada or threatening hindi or threatening punjabi are all attacks on india. so our strength unlike many other countries, our strength comes from our diversity, our strength comes from accepting that we are all different, but we can work together and that is an idea that i'm sure you and the congress party are protecting. thank you. 

**question 3** - hello rahulji, i am ganapathy. we welcome you here. we wholeheartedly thank you for taking up the fight against the fascism. so this rise of fascism is not a mere coincidence - and we believe in the social and the economic equality in the society and the inequality actually creates a conducive environment for fascism to emerge. so my question is like what is the plan of the indian national congress to improve the economic and the social inequality which creates this condition for fascism in the indian subcontinent and also at the global level. 

**rahul gandhi** - one of the things that we are suggesting is when we were in government we had carried out a caste census and the idea behind the caste senses was to take an x-ray of indian society - to find out what are the exact demographics of our country, what are the different communities, what are the different costs, how many people in each community, how many people in each caste, because without understanding our demographics and without understanding who is who, it is very difficult to distribute wealth, distribute power effectively.

so that was one idea that we had and we've been putting pressure on the bjp to release the caste census, the numbers and they are of course not doing it and we'll continue to apply pressure and if we come to power we will do that but we are committed as the congress party to make india a fair place and we understand deeply that india today in terms of its treatment of dalits, tribals, poor people, minorities is not a fair place. and, there are many many things that can be done - there is the nyay scheme that we had which was aimed at providing a minimum income to all indians, there are ideas like mnrega. i think an increase in public education, increase in public health care - i thinkthese are all things that can be done to make india a much more equal and fair place. thank you.


**question 4** - rahulji, now the parliament lok sabha seats are increasing to 888 - what's your take on it? there's a proposal that you know modiji is actually working on-  it is going to be entirely based on population. it is going to tilt you know the orientation towards the highly popular states getting more and more lion share of the revenues and everything - so it's going to change everything you know - minorities are going to get even more depressed, you know majorities are going to be you know making everybody vulnerable - so what's your take on it?

**rahul gandhi** - exactly how they're thinking about doingit - but i think one has to be very very carefully - when one change changes the representative structure of a country. so i'd be quite interested in understanding exactly how they've comeup with the number 800 [sic] and what are the criteria that they're using - these things should not be done flippantly. india is a conversation, india is a negotiation between its languages, between its people, between its histories and cultures and that negotiation has to be fair - meaning all parts of india, all the states of india should feel that there is fairness in the process of negotiation. if i see exactly how they are coming up with 800 and what is the design then i would be able to answer whether i agree with the number 800 but i haven't seen the way they're calculating it [inaudible audio in the background], but it depends how they how the ratios change- yeah it is currently based on the population but you'll have to see how the ratios change. 

i think the parliament house - these are the distractions - the real issues in india are unemployment, price rise, spread of anger and hatred , crumbling education system, price of education, price of health care - these are the real issues. bjp can't really discuss them, so then they have to do the whole skepter thing, you know lying down and doing all that aren't you happy i'm not lying down? thank you.

**question 5** - rahulji, thank you so much for coming all the way here. i think this is something which we were starving for as muslims from the bay area. we all want to thank you for your time and for your efforts in coming all the way here. as you know that you know muslims have the security threat today like it was never before. the way we see today, like whenever we call and talk to anybody, it's like what's going on. there are so many different laws which are getting implemented which were not even implemented earlier - if it is just about the security it's okay, but then if it goes on and they are putting muslim kids in the jails for the crime they have not committed - what strategy will you adopt or what hope are you giving to indian muslims which is going to change the whole thing back to the point where we were and get back to the normal stream to develop india the the best way?

**rahul gandhi** - for me to explain that is the line - nafrat ke bazaar mein mohabbat ki dukaan kholi (*we opened a shop of love amidst the market of hate*) - that is the best way i can say it which is that it is felt most strongly by the muslim community. okay, because it is done most directly to them but in fact it is being done to all minorities - i can guarantee you that the same way you're feeling attacked, i can guarantee you my sikh brothers are feeling the same thing, i can guarantee you my christian brothers are feeling the same, i can guarantee you, the dalit community is feeling the same thing tribal communities feeling the same thing right - in fact anybody who is poor in india today - when he looks at the extreme wealth that a limited number of people have, in some way, he feels the same thing that you feel that what is going on? how is it that these five people have lakhs of crores and i have nothing to eat? so, you feel it most because it is directed at you most aggressively but it is a phenomena that is taking place against everybody in india right and you cannot cut hatred with hatred. it's impossible. you know that. you can only cut hatred with love and affection.

i was surprised at how easy it was to erase hatred in india. i was shocked. i didn't imagine that [speaks in hindi] - *walking from one place to another could make such a great difference.* i didn't imagine it. indian people, as you yourself have said, they don't believe in this stuff, they don't believe in hating each other, they don't believe in killing each other. this is a small group of people who have got control of the system, who've got control of the media and who are fully supported by you know - big money. but this is not the large mass of indian people - i can guarantee you. i walked from kanyakumari to kashmir, i can guarantee you there are more people who believe in love and affection than hatred - millions and millions more.

so, don't be pessimistic. also, i'd like to point out another thing. this happens periodically in india. what is happening for example to the muslim community in india today - happened to the dalit community in the 80s. if you went up to them in the 80s - what is happening with the muslims is what was happening with the dalits. so, periodically, this type of stuff happens and we have to challenge it, we have to fight it and we have to fight it with affection and not fight it with hatred. we will do that. thank you. 

**question 6** - welcome rahul sir and thank you so much for your win in karnataka. you've made a lot of people very very happy. we've literally cried tears of joy - so thank you. my question for you would be that we have a lot of students who helped out here today - we really feel passionately for your cause and which is our cause now but what would you say to us if we want to go back to india - we want to represent our country - but we see how the athletes, the youth, the wrestlers there in recent times are being treated, it's very undignified - we feel very discouraged. so, what would you say to us to kind of bring the sense of wanting to go back out there for our country? 

**rahul gandhi** - please realize that there's a huge distortion - india is not what the media shows - the media likes to show you a particular narrative - it likes to promote a particular narrative that is actually not what is going on in india. it was very clear to me in the yatra that it's in the media's interest to project these things. it helps the bjp. so, don't think that everything you see in the media is the truth and as a young person, your country needs you - your skills and your energy will be very useful to your country. so if you feel like going back, do go back and help out. thank you.

**concluding remarks** - you are all ambassadors of a particular vision of our country - you believe in humility, you believe in respect, you believe in being affectionate to each other - so do not answer with anger and hatred - with love and affection, show them that you are not like them [applause] you should support the ideas that will defeat the bjp. thank you very much."

fuckers charges at bikes and scooties like people driving are their archenemy. they will chase for like 5 to 10 seconds then stop. but when you stop confront, they act like fucking chickens and run away.

i initially thought on my first encounter at my hometown that some puppy from that pack might have gotten killed by some vehicle and so they hate all and any vehicles, fair enough. but no, not only the stray dogs of my hometown have gone crazy but it seems the problem is in other cities too. idk wtf is happening."

reddit,2023-06-15 16:21:07,"potential of artificial intelligence in india i would like to hear your opinions on the future of india in relation to artificial intelligence. do you believe that india can develop its own ai system that can compete with the leading ones such as chatgpt, google bard and microsoft's bing ai? i firmly believe that india has the potential to create an ai system that is not only comparable but superior to the existing ones. this can also boost the economy by creating more jobs and introducing new kinds of professions that we have never imagined before. furthermore, if we integrate our ai with our technology, we could achieve unprecedented levels of innovation and excellence. imagine all the wonderful things we could accomplish.

according to various estimates, ai can increase india's annual growth rate by **1.3 percentage points** by 2035. ai can benefit indian society and economy in many ways, such as:

- reducing human-intensive labour by leveraging on smart automation
- increasing efficiency in pharma and healthcare industry
- transforming the financial sector
- quicker and easier customer service using ai chat-bots
- enhancing safety on roads
- predicting and enabling quicker response to disaster

ai can also improve the quality and access of education in india, which is a key factor for social development and empowerment. ai can help in designing personalized learning paths, providing adaptive feedback, creating immersive learning environments, and facilitating peer-to-peer learning. ai can also help in addressing the challenges of teacher shortage, student dropout, and learning outcomes.

ai is not only a technology but also a vision for india's future. it is a vision that is grounded in the fundamental rights afforded to citizens by the constitution and guided by the principles of responsible ai for all. it is a vision that aims to solve the pressing problems faced by millions of indians and create a more inclusive, prosperous, and sustainable society. i think we have the capacity to produce something remarkable. india has so many talented and intelligent people who can make this vision a reality by creating an ai system that is unparalleled.

weather is terrible, just unbearable, hot &amp; humid, i'm sweating in liters. 

coming to other cultural aspects, everyone i met for my cab or work at store has a blore connection. i swear ! 

my furniture showroom owner did bachelor's in engineering, my ac vendor has son working in blore, my usual cab driver worked in blore,  mechanic on the road lived in shivajinagar etc.

finding a home is like game of chess, everyone says they are quite progressive wrt to their thought process. but when it comes to renting home, caste plays dominant role, religion is tertiary here. this place is still in 1920s wrt to caste discrimination and people are just ignorant and flagrant wrt to caste system. it's annoying and sinister. loads of power cuts. 

women who don western wear are stared, like there is no tomorrow. i literally look in their eyes when i walk with my girl. just hate that part. 


bihar i've seen a trend if you are outspoken women or confident about yourself, managers tend to put them down. the insecurities around women at work still exist. 

worst thing, like delhi ""janta hain mera baap kaun hain"" bihar hain 'cacha humare vidhayak hain"" culture. 

everyone here loves govt job :) 

people are nice, infra is quite better compared to blore (barring the honking people here do), cleaner roads without potholes. the life is just slow takes me to early childhood in towns in karnataka.

reddit,2023-06-23 02:52:33,"rant: india's power crisis is absolutely embarrassing. it's 2 am. i'm sitting in 40 degree heat, drenched in sweat as i'm writing this. my partner has somehow forced herself to sleep. and my pet is probably too uncomfortable to even say anything. haven't even had dinner since it's so hot, i can't even eat. 

why? no power that's why. 

every summer i see politicians promising adequate power supply and what not. that they're rebuilding infra, improving discoms, reducing shortage etc. and every summer there are power cuts for 4-6 hours long in this terrible heat. early morning, noon, afternoon, evening, night, late night - it's like a little guessing game. and i can't even imagine how people are living in places that have 10-14 hour blackouts every other day. 

i live in gurgaon in a rented flat and that too in a decent locality. the real estate here is hot. yet i don't understand why oh why has the power situation not improved at all. it's so bad that even my inverter has died out. i have barely 20% battery left on my phone. 

why has india not been able to fix its power (and water) crisis? it's been 75 years since independence and yet even the biggest cities here have load shedding. hell, i stay in a city but places in rural india, hinterland, smaller towns have it much much worse. these things are literally the absolute basics to survive after housing, food, clothing. i cannot wrap my mind around the fact that we have this entire parade of politicians and industrialists who beat their chests yet can't even provide a basic necessity like power? matlab kis level ki kaamchori aur corruption hogi ki yeh log bijli ki problem solve nahi kar pa rahe. what is the point of being proud of your achievements if you can't even do your basics right?! 

most of our thermal plants have a huge coal shortage. half of them are not in good condition. transformers are busted and old. no upgrades for better infra. so bc kar kya rahe hai?! i've lived through power cuts for as long as i remember, more than 30 years. and aaj bhi bc raat ko garmi mein baithna padh raha hai. office ka kaam ruka padha hai. the electricity customer care stops taking calls after 9pm. the sdo/linemen stop picking up calls. all i have is a fucking whatsapp chat bot that gives me a complaint number. why should anyone go thru this shit after paying so much tax money? 

it boils my blood that for the suffering of so many people in india, a few corrupt mofos get away. there are so many places in india where power hasn't even reached. or only get 4-5 hours of power every day. and yet you have power ministers nicely living in homes with 10+ acs. 

of course, we are to blame as well. we are way too many people for the amount of power we produce. just can't deal with the load. plus the elite bougee crowd jo ek hi ghar mein 4 ac use karte hai. 

but as a country, don't we deserve at least this much? bc poora desh ko inn mantriyon ne bech daala hai. and then you have all the pr machinery, all the optics, all the fucking roadshows and shosha and tomtoming about ""look india is such a great country, fastest economy vishwaguru blah blah"" 

abey kya lowde ka economy karoge agar ghar mein bijli hi nahi hai? kya fayda yeh sab show off karne ka jab dikhaane ke liye kuchh hai hi nahi?! kya karoge aise politicians ko support karke and following their cheapass religious narrative? first world country ke naam pe kya hi ukhaad liya tumne jab basic facilities like law and order, infra, healthcare, employment, education hi nahi de paaye?! 

so so so sooooo fed up with the state of affairs. and electricity crisis is not even our biggest concern. it's just one of the few that the privileged are used to. corruption, dogmatism, exploitation, doglapan, yehi karte rahenge sab. 

i love this country and i love its beautiful people. this is not a rant against india. but against those who run the state, those who give fake promises and exploit the people's money and effort, those who spit on the dignity of hard working tax paying citizens, and those who support these guys knowing how evil they are. 

rant over. 

ps: i want to know what you guys think should be the solution to india's power crisis. what kind of technologies should we adapt? should solar be used more extensively? how can consumers like us help in better power management? or can we come together in someway and question the ones responsible for this? will india ever come out of this situation or even get 30-40% better than what it is today? 

i repeat, this is not a hate post. just an epiphany about where we are right now.

the bellandur lane road becomes a witness to the sewage water that threatens to overflow on it. when exactly will be the bridge made. i have read news articles saying the ministry has asked to progress on the lake cleaning and bridge construction during night time. i have gone around that area at night many times and different times but haven't seen any activity.
one month of living in my apartment and during rain and on windy days i can smell a sewage like smell in my apartment. i can't spot any sewage problem near my flat, i wonder if it is the smell of the lake that carries over to the nearby area.

does anyone have any specific knowledge about the legal responsibility for the last mile connection?

basically bescom has not connected the underground cable to our meter - they are relying on the overhead aluminium cable which is supposed to be used only as a temporary connection. i am worried about the monsoon rains causing problems - electrocuting someone.

we've spoken to the aee and other people at the bescom e6 and even mailed the md of bescom but they/workers/contractor have cemented completely the distribution-box and left both ends of the cable unattended/unconnected - they cut out a length of wire but have not connected it to our old cable that exits the house.

meanwhile all the pavement work is completed and the gutter through which they have run the power cables is cemented up so i'm wondering when they will finish our work and if ultimately we are responsible for the last mile.

but i live in kanpur and called the highway like road going like 200 m from our home, the gt road since childhood. it's also designated so in google maps.

the problem is: i live on the north west part of kanpur and the highway makes the turn to southwest to agra via auraiya much southeast of our home. the highway near our home leads to kannauj. and as per internet, there seems to be gt road in kannuaj. that also seems true in google maps.

does the gt road goes through kannauj? if yes, then why do all the maps of gt road on internet show the route making a southwest turn from kanpur and not kannauj? and kannuaj is also not mentioned anywhere in the literature about gt road, so why there is a gt road in kannauj?

i was recently tasked with re-vamping an existing apartment complex to make it more habitable, it has around 50 units consisting of both a mix of 1bhks and 1rks. before diving in and seeing what needs to be changed. i wanted to conduct some market research. so tell me fellow bangaloreans, what plagues you, and what i can add to help alleviate our problems?  


about the apartment:   


\- amazing location connects right to 27th main road, has access to everything literally within 100m in all directions, nift college for any students, a slew of supermarkets (mk ahmed, + everything on 27th main), a bar (plan b the wings + beer offer is 🤌🏻) + in 500m you have others house of commons etc, many workspaces and a starbucks 300m away! 

\- definitely needs a slight aesthetic revamp - any suggestions welcome! 

\- has 24/7 kaveri and borewell water connection 

\- has a 24/7 caretaker on-prem - any maintenance is included 

\- has a cook you can hire on-prem 

&amp;#x200b;

my initial ideas: 

\- add a power backup to each house 

\- add high-speed wi-fi to each flat  + router 

\- add in furniture (a bed, refrigerator, a workstation (a table), and a washing machine)

\- make it an inclusive area open to all genders and religions with strict no moral policing (shouldn't be anyone's business anyways)

\- enforcement of a 10 pm silent time for any families and working folks 

\- thinking about a community area with a chair and table etc, but idk, would people be open to socializing 

\- car parking is available but limited to 8 spots, car parking is available on the road or on an empty plot right next to the building (hasn't been confirmed i am yet to speak to the owner of that plot)

\- 2 - wheeler parking is available

\- open to one dog/cat per apartment, whatever else is up to your discretion

reddit,2023-07-15 19:04:56,"stay away from moto (motorola)  on january 29th, 2023, i purchased a moto g52 smartphone along with the extended warranty and complete mobile protection plan as suggested by flipkart. however, after only 5 months of use, a green line suddenly appeared on the right side of the phone's display. interestingly, the line would fade out after a minute of usage.

to avoid voiding the warranty, i decided not to get the phone repaired immediately from a local repair shop (barely 5 mins away) and instead contacted flipkart. their executive advised me to return the phone, considering it was still under warranty (excluding the additional warranties and complete protection plan i purchased).

i carefully packaged the product, ensuring it was securely wrapped, and handed it over to the bluedart executive who came to collect it. the phone was returned in its original packaging, as i had concerns about the lack of a cardboard box for transportation. i specifically used the original case for the return.

this occurred on july 11th. today, july 15th, i received an email from protect\_jeeves stating that the device has ""liquid damage"" and is now considered out of warranty. to make matters worse, they are requesting an additional 1000 rupees to fix it.

this situation is highly unacceptable because not only is the device still under warranty, but i also paid an extra 600 rupees to ensure its safety. i can confidently state that the device was never exposed to water or any other liquid, as jeeves claims it is. there was not a single instance where it was introduced to such an environment. it is extremely disappointing and frankly insulting that this issue is being attributed to my own error.

&amp;#x200b;

the problem i initially encountered was a light green line appearing on the right side of the display, which would fade away after a minute of usage. since i handed over the product to the bluedart executive in its original casing, i have no knowledge of how they handled the device during transit. a simple google search would show you that this is a recurring issue with the g52 model.

this is the exact issue that i faced: [https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/moto-g-5g-2022/getting-green-line-issue-on-moto-g52/m-p/5188329](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/moto-g-5g-2022/getting-green-line-issue-on-moto-g52/m-p/5188329) [https://www.lifewire.com/fix-green-line-android-phone-5509491](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-green-line-android-phone-5509491)

\--

if you’re a company that wants to buy another company, but you don’t have the cash to actually buy it, you might take a loan from a bank and keep the company you just bought as collateral. if you then realise that you’re unable to pay back this loan, your options look like this:

1. give up your collateral! you took a risk, it didn’t work out. suck it up and move on.
2. sell some equity in your company to investors, then use that money to pay back the loan.

option (1) is straightforward and convenient. but it means that you lose the shiny company you just bought. with option (2), you get to keep the company you bought, but you lose part of your own company, because you sell a stake in it. if you’re desperate for the money (which you are), and if the funding market isn’t great (which it isn’t), you might get a bad deal.

in 2021, pharmeasy bought a 66% stake in thyrocare technologies for [₹4,546 crore](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/pharmeasy-to-acquire-66-stake-in-thyrocare-in-rs-4500-crore-deal/articleshow/83842616.cms) ($550 million) from its founder arokiaswamy velumani. velumani then reinvested ₹1,500 crore back into pharmeasy for around 5% of the company. \[1\] effectively, pharmeasy spent ₹3,046 crore ($370 million) in cash to buy up thyrocare.

pharmeasy borrowed most of this ₹3,046 crore and kept its stake in thyrocare, which is a listed company, as collateral. it now owes goldman sachs about ₹2,500 crore ($300 million) which it is, of course, not able to pay back. yesterday, [cnbc-tv18 reported](https://www.cnbctv18.com/startup/pharmeasy-api-holdings-rights-issue-valuation-drop-debt-repayment-goldman-sachs-thyrocare-17246661.htm) that pharmeasy decided to go with option (2) and raise more money by selling some stake to investors.

down but not out

here’s [cnbc-tv18](https://www.cnbctv18.com/startup/pharmeasy-api-holdings-rights-issue-valuation-drop-debt-repayment-goldman-sachs-thyrocare-17246661.htm):

&gt;api holdings, the owner of pharmeasy, in an all-investor meeting on july 17 has agreed to do a rights issue of rs 2,000 - rs 3,000 crore, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told *cnbc-tv18.* the sources further said that the pharmeasy parent has also approved the manipal group's proposal to invest the shortfall amount if all investors do not end up participating.  
the board of api holdings is said to have approved manipal group's binding offer but only to the tune of non-participation by existing shareholders. manipal group's family office has offered to invest up to rs 1,300 crore, sources said.  
… depending on the amount of funds raised, the post-money valuation of the company is expected to be around rs 6,000 to rs 7,000 crore.

complicated! pharmeasy is clearly a confused, non-committal piece of work. pharmeasy owes goldman sachs ₹2,500 crore. it’s planning to raise maybe ₹2,000 or ₹3,000 crore from existing investors. in case these investors don’t (or can’t) invest the entire amount, pharmeasy will sell its stake to manipal group, which is not currently an investor. manipal will invest ₹1,300 crore at a valuation of around ₹6,000 crore to ₹7,000 crore ($730 million to $850 million).

pharmeasy’s last funding round was at a [$5.6 billion valuation](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/pharmeasy-plans-rs-2400-crore-rights-issue-at-90-cut-in-share-price/articleshow/101510154.cms?from=mdr#:~:text=down%20from%20the%20high%20of%20%245.6%20billion%20two%20years%20ago.) two years ago. now, it’s going to be around $800 million which is *85%* lower. a down round, that is, raising money from investors at a valuation lower than your previous funding round, is a bit of a taboo in startup circles. one reason for this is purely cosmetic. if a startup that a venture capital fund has invested in reduces its valuation, the fund then has to tell its own investors that it has made a loss, which doesn’t look very nice. but another, more practical reason for the taboo is that down rounds basically squeeze the company out from the hands of older investors.

here’s how it goes:

1. let’s say you own 50% of a company at a ₹1000 valuation.
2. if the company now reduces its valuation by 85%, it reduces the value of your stock by 85% too. but hey, that’s okay, at least you still own 50% of the company.
3. but if the company now sells away 20% of its stake to investors that aren’t you, your 50% stake goes down. the total pie is limited, after all. if 20% goes to other investors, your 50% stake goes down to 40%. \[2\]

manipal group is willing to invest ₹1,300 crore ($160 million) at $800 million, which means that it would get 20% of pharmeasy. if manipal gets 20%, older investors that also don’t invest get stifled. so obviously, they’re not going to be happy. from [et prime last week](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/prime/technology-and-startups/pharmeasys-uneasy-downround-not-all-shareholders-happy-with-prescription/primearticleshow/101642032.cms):

&gt;[pharmeasy](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/pharmeasy)’s plan to take a 90% cut in valuation in an upcoming internal funding round has not gone down well with all shareholders. it will be one of the biggest value erosions and among the first such downrounds for the unicorn if the round goes through.  
…  
but some shareholders are also looking to put up a counter offer to the share price, sources told et prime. some investors believe pharmeasy could be worth more than usd500 million, and hence they would want to push up the price in the range of inr15-inr 20 per share.  
…  
there is a strong view among a section of investors and analysts that the proposed price is below par, and there could be some resistance to the proposed downround. some of the early investors have maintained a studied silence and there is likely to be some behind-the-scenes action before this round goes through. ""there is much drama now. the company is clearly more valuable than this,"" said another early stage vc investor, requesting not to be identified.

yess, drama! though i’d have expected a lot more. this drama is pretty tame in comparison to whatever is happening over at byju’s. anyway, pharmeasy has given its existing investors a choice. either pay up the money that it needs, around ₹2,500 crore, or it will raise money from manipal group even though it’s a cheap-ass stake sale that cuts them out. it’s obvious though that the choice here is a farce. if older investors were willing (and able) to invest this large an amount into the company, this down round shenanigan wouldn’t have happened in the first place.

**old investors are new investors**

there is *some* drama to it. pharmeasy and manipal group have some common investors. temasek holdings and tpg combined own about 18% of pharmeasy and a mammoth [70%](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/temasek-buys-majority-stake-in-manipal-hospitals/articleshow/99313658.cms?from=mdr) of manipal group. manipal *is* temasek and tpg! it’s not a random outside investor but temasek-tpg, older investors themselves, trying to stifle all other investors. more from et prime:

&gt;some reports also suggest that the two common investors in manipal health and pharmeasy — temasek and tpg — are pushing for consolidation. after the rights issue, pai, tpg, and temasek would together hold more than 35% stake in pharmeasy. they would be in a position to take a controlling stake by buying shares of the existing early backers in secondary transactions. they may explore offering a decent exit to early investors by paying them a significantly higher price vis-a-vis the rights issue.

once manipal invests in pharmeasy, temasek-tpg combined will own a large 38% stake in the company. that would give them enough power in the company to convince other investors to sell them their stakes. sure, the valuation for this sale would be more than the $800 million at which manipal is buying its stake, but it’s definitely not going to be anywhere near the $5.6 billion valuation pharmeasy had earlier. is it going to be a “decent exit” for the investors who sell? i don’t know. you could call it that. or you could also call it a mercy killing.

why is thyrocare so important to everyone here? pharmeasy could very well have sold off thyrocare, paid off its loan, and called it a day. i guess the opportunity to buy pharmeasy for cheap is too alluring for temasek-tpg to pass up on.

**footnotes**

\[1\] this was a bit of a weird transaction. pharmeasy could’ve easily given velumani cash and stock, instead of giving him cash and then asking to him to invest it back into pharmeasy. the reason they did this though is that had they given stock to him, it would be at a $2 billion valuation, the last valuation it had raised money at. but when velumani invested his money back into pharmeasy, he did so at a $4 billion valuation—that’s double! a fund way to increase your company’s valuation, i guess.

\[2\] technically, an older investor’s stake goes down at every funding round, regardless of whether it’s a down round or not. but when it’s a round at a higher valuation, the size of the pie goes up too. so the value of the earlier investor’s stock goes up, even if the % stake goes down.

reddit,2023-07-31 05:39:23,"a man in a lunghi outside my house, cairns, australia. there was an indian man wearing a lunghi tied up like a bengali/bihari’s outside my house in cairns, australia a couple days ago. it was 6am, and i was going to work. he looked work-old with leather skin but his eyes looked young. he was very thin. i think he was around forty years old. he had a sack next to him, and he was perched up on his crossed legs. he was wearing a button up shirt and i felt certain he had cash stashed in the roll of his lunghi on his right side. i asked him how he was in english, and he didn’t know english. i asked him in bangla and he said something back to me that i didn’t know and smiled. i don’t speak urdu or hindi, nor do i speak bengali well but i’m fairly sure it wasn’t any of those. he looked exactly like he was waiting for a truck or a bus or a train at howrah or old delhi. he looked like a bihari waiting on the streets of kolkata just south of howrah bridge near bbd bagh before the covid shut down waiting for the trucks to do a border run for bihar.  he looked like he was from a village that takes two trains and a bike to get to with houses perched on water and dogs and fighting children and something cooking somewhere.

i’ve been thinking about it ever since. i have no problem with him. i just don’t understand how he managed to get here, or who he was. all i can think of is perhaps he is someone’s parent, but he didn’t look like it. i asked someone from kerala, and they nodded and started complaining about refugees and how terrible they are and got quite angry about poor people having more than they deserve. but i just want to know the logistics. i don’t care about the politics.

does anyone know how someone i’m describing could get the visa, get the passport, get to australia and be waiting outside my suburban ordinary home at 6am on a weekday?"
reddit,2023-08-01 23:44:41,"water problem in apartment is creating lots of issues. are you facing water issues? hi all,

we are staying in an apartment near cmrit (aecs layout). 

myself and wife are in it and we have a child. we cannot plan our work properly because we dont know when does water stops. 
i know there was water shortage few months back across bangalore. are we still in the same situation even after these many rains?! 

maid leaves home with uncleaned vessels because of water stoppage. owner claims that he is buying water separately (but never shows the proof). on top of this, we recently came to know that owner asked watchman to stop the water supply for 2 hours daily!!! he asks separate money for water. this month he asked 1500 + rent. 

most of the days, water stops at prime time (7am to 9am). this is very crucial timings. preparing kid to school, etc...... 
and water stops at evening, night (random).

we were the one first asked owner about this issue. he told us to vacate. shocked! we just reported the water issue and explained how we are struggling but we got such response. 

later on, all flatmates reported it to owner and he is responding with same attitude. this apartment has less than 20 house. he made 3 families to vacate already. he gave the notice to 2 other families. they are local and they told they wont vacate. 

my wife doesnt want to vacate because of the child. he gets sick often and we have doctors nearby. so she doesnt want to vacate. we have  no car. 

owner already raised rent twice within a year. very very greedy owner. we all know how bad the housing market is. owner is trying hard to vacate families and bring in bachelors for hefty rent. he told that he has many people in line to move-in. 

my wife told, we can pay the water amount if there are no water supply issues. her point is very valid. who can pay the full price for a broken phone?

question: how bad is the water problem in bangalore now? are you also going through this?"
reddit,2023-08-03 11:26:34,"bought the bounce infinity scooter and feels like i got scammed. what are my options? so, the title pretty much.

i got the scooter about 3 weeks ago and quite frankly i'm enjoying it. the ride is an absolute pleasure. no vibration (typical for an ev) and the handling is sweet. just love it. a couple of issues and the support however totally undoes it. 

here's more to it:

1. the headlamp problem: it projects rectangular beam instead of an all round beam. can't picture it? just imagine a regular scooter with lights on at night. you see how it looks and how light is distributed as it lights up the path before it? i haven't even talked about the high beam part, so just you wait. now, for bounce, the light that's supposed to illuminate the road only falls at a certain rectangular patch a little ahead of you/the scooter. a fairly wide (left to right) but a smaller height (top to bottom). that's the normal beam. when you switch to the high beam, it's two separate patches, like one that's formed by the regular beam, as described earlier, and another a little further from it, same rectangular shape again. and there is a visible black patch between the two - where the light doesn't fall. it's as though there's supposed to be bulb but isn't there. 


2. the center stand: it's always hitting the underfloor because of the absolutely fantastic bengaluru roads. and because of this there is always that hitting sounds - breaks my heart each time. looks like the spring is loose. the technician said that's it's a known issue and they'll come home to fix it once they get the part apparently and that's not happened yet.


3. the app doesn't work: i was told that the app would have great features, when i was buying, saw a couple of videos on youtube where they use the app too, so assumed it'd work, and at the showroom, when i asked to see the functionality of the app, there was conveniently no vehicle with the app connected. and after i bought it, i was told that the app is under maintenance and would be ready by end of july (a couple of days ago). but still nothing. should have gone over the playstore's review, but it didn't occur to me then. now going over the abysmal reviews i feel many have been scammed.


4. the battery indicator: clarification - the battery itself delivers as promised, 70 kms on full charge on eco and 55 kms on power. takes about 4 hours to fully charge - i have no problems there, but on the battery there is this indicator that's supposed to show you the charging status - like how mobile phones have - that does not work. during the test drive too, i was told all this would work. apparently the battery also has a sim for gps tracking and i have no idea where it goes and how it works. 


i kinda feel sad, because i feel i have been sold a half baked product for the full price (~ ₹117000). i spent a fortune on it and at the very least they should address my issue. i contacted the support on email (because that's what i prefer over calls for obvious reasons), and they've been dodging the questions about #1, #2 and #4 saying they would like to talk to me on phone. 


so, am i fucked or can i do something about it? it's barely been weeks since i bought it."
reddit,2023-08-03 19:18:56,"the draft digital personal data protection, 2023 is here... | iff's first read | #saveourprivacy #smh  

### tl;dr

the ministry of electronics &amp; information technology has introduced the [**draft**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jbxwvqzpdmvffkhgavpxru-nhotfqp2n/view?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) digital personal data protection bill, 2023 before the parliament today. below, we present our initial thoughts on the draft proposal and how it compares to the 2022 draft. we strongly urge the union government to address the numerous recurring problems with successive iterations that have been raised by civil society stakeholders.

 

### background

https://preview.redd.it/u4wt0tukgwfb1.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8211ac65ec5d00bb4c86426ad0df53497be5be3c

 an expert committee on privacy headed by justice a.p. shah under the erstwhile planning commission presented a report on october 12, 2012 which serves as an influential document on international &amp; national privacy standards.the expert committee on data protection chaired by justice bn srikrishna was constituted by the ministry for electronics and information technology (“meity”) on july 31, 2017. the committee released its 176 page report to the meity and proposed the personal data protection bill, 2018 on july 27, 2018. as soon as the personal data protection bill, 2019 (“pdpb, 2019”) was introduced in the parliament on december 11, 2019, it was sent to a joint parliamentary committee (“jpc”) with members from both the houses for its review and suggestions. after nearly two years and several extensions, the joint committee on the personal data protection bill, 2019 brought out its report on december 16, 2021. the report also contained a new version of the law titled, “the data protection bill, 2021” (“dbp, 2021”). however, the dpb, 2021 was withdrawn by the minister for communications and information technology, ashwini vaishnaw on august 3, 2022. the ministry of electronics &amp; information technology released the draft digital personal data protection bill, 2022 (dpdpb, 2022) on november 18, 2022 for public consultation. the notice accompanying the dpdpb, 2022 stated that submissions made as part of the consultation process will not be made public.

### overall analysis

1. **consultation and introduction process raises concerns**: the notice accompanying the dpdpb, 2022 stated that comments received will not be made public by meity. further, the consultation process required interested participants to register on the mygov website in order to be able to provide comments which was a significant hurdle. here, parliamentary procedure also may have been circumvented when the standing committee on information technology took up the dpdpb, 2023 even though it was not formally referred to it, a move which led the opposition party members of the standing committee to [**walk out**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/data-protection-bill-parliamentary-panel-adopts-report-amid-opposition-walkout/articleshow/102149678.cms?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) from the meeting adopting the report.
2. **weak notice requirement**s: compared to the 2019 &amp; 2021 versions, data fiduciaries do not have to inform principals about the third-parties with whom their data will be shared, the duration for which their data will be stored and if their data will be transferred to other countries.
3. **vague non-consensual processing of data permitted**: the dpdpb, 2022 allowed the data fiduciary to assume consent of the data principal if the processing was considered necessary as per certain situations such as for the breakdown of public order, for purposes related to employment, and in public interest. the “deemed consent” clause of dpdpb, 2022 has now been replaced with the “certain legitimate uses” clause with only the public interest sub-clause being removed in dpdpb, 2023.
4. **duties and penalties imposed on data principals**: duties such as not registering a false or frivolous grievance or complaint have been imposed on the data principal, the violation of which could result in penalties (of upto 10,000 inr).
5. **vague factors for data transfer**: the dpdpb, 2022 did away with the requirement of data localisation contained in the 2019 &amp; 2021 iterations but proposed to put in place an allowlist of countries that would be eligible to receive indian data. the dpdpb, 2023 further changes this provision to propose that a blocklist of countries will be notified instead to which indian data may not be transferred. however, the factors based on which it will be determined that a country may or may not be eligible to receive indian data have not been specified.
6. **exemptions created for private actors**: the dpdpb, 2022 provided the union government with the power to exempt certain data fiduciaries or class of data fiduciaries from selected provisions. the dpdpb, 2023 retains this provision and specifically includes startups as data fiduciaries that may be exempted by the union government.
7. **exemptions for government widened further**: the union government had retained the power to exempt any government instrumentality (gi) from the application of the dpdpb, 2022. additionally, the dpdpb, 2022 also failed to put into place any meaningful safeguards against overbroad surveillance which weakens the right to privacy of indian citizens. the dpdpb, 2023 has further widened the scope of these exemptions by expanding it to include any processing of data done by the union government on information provided to it by an exempted instrumentality. thus, the data collected by these instrumentalities itself will be exempted.
8. **data protection board’s independence under question**: in the dpdpb, 2022 the union government had been empowered to prescribe the strength and composition of the data protection board, the process of selection, terms and conditions of appointment and service, removal of its chairperson and other members at a later stage as well as appointing the chief executive of the board. however, the dpdpb, 2023 weakens the dpb further as all appointments will now be made by the union government.
9. **weakening of the right to information act, 2005**: through amendments, the dpdpb, 2023 removes the public interest exception to disclosure of personal information under the right to information act, 2005.
10. **failure to carry out surveillance reform**: in addition to providing wide exemptions to the state, the dpdpb, 2023 also fails to put into place any meaningful safeguards against overbroad surveillance which weakens the right to privacy of indian citizens.
11. **power to block access to information introduced**: the dpdpb, 2023 has empowered the union government to block access to any information if it receives a direction from the dpb to restrict such information in the interest of the general public.
12. **important provisions left to future executive rule-making**: the dpdpb, 2023 lists 25 specific situations for which the union government will notify rules at a later stage and also gives itself the leeway to notify rules at a later stage for “any other matter which is to be or may be prescribed”. this cripples the ability of stakeholders to meaningfully engage with the draft proposal.  

### analysis of the key changes in dpdpb, 2023

**a. deemed consent rebranded to “certain legitimate uses”**

clause 7 of the dpdpb, 2023 pertains to “certain legitimate uses”. this clause replaces the “deemed consent” clause of dpdpb, 2022 in name; however, the content of the clause largely remains the same. the clause states that processing of personal data may be done without obtaining the informed consent of the data principal in certain situations. the dpdpb, 2022 was widely criticised for facilitating non-consensual processing of personal data. the dpdpb, 2023 varies from the 2022 iteration by omitting the sub-clause which allowed consent to be deemed in “public interest”. this is a positive development since the sub-clause failed to strictly define the situations in which it may be invoked and thus, could have been widely interpreted leading to misuse.

**b.** **processing of personal data outside india to be done according to a blocklist**

clause 16 of the dpdpb, 2023 relates to the transfer and processing of personal data outside india. while the 2022 draft provided for a allowlist of countries to which data transfer would be allowed, the dpdpb, 2023 proposes a blocklist of countries to which data transfer would not be allowed. thus, data transfer will be allowed to all countries which are not on the blocklist. the blocklist will be notified by the union government upon the assessment of such factors as it may consider necessary. here, it is disappointing that an exhaustive list of the necessary factors which the union government would consider to arrive at the blocklist have not been included in the dpdpb, 2023. it is essential that the criteria for inclusion on the blocklist be specifically defined to protect against arbitrary standards.

**c. government exemptions expanded**

clause 17(2)(a) of the dpdpb, 2023 expands the scope of the exemptions provided to government instrumentalities and their data processing activities. in the 2022 draft, processing of personal data by notified instrumentalities of the union government was exempted from the application of the bill. in dpdpb, 2023, this exemption has been expanded to include any processing of data done by the union government on information provided to it by an exempted instrumentality. thus, any information once collected by an exempted instrumentality and shared with the union government would continue to be exempted from the purview of the bill, regardless of whether it is being processed by an exempted instrumentality of the union government. any exemptions sought by government agencies should be granted only if they fulfil the standards of legality, necessity, and proportionality. it is essential that government collection and processing of citizen data is regulated to prevent misuse.

**d. data protection board still weak**

chapters 5 and 6 of the dpdpb, 2023 relates to the data protection board (dpb). the provisions related to the dpb have worsened considerably. in the 2022 draft, only the chairperson of the dpb was to be appointed by the union government. however, in dpdpb, 2023, all members of the dpb will now be appointed by the union government. this strengthens the criticism that had been levied at previous versions of the bill which questioned the independence of the dpb. it is essential that the board is independent of executive control. this was also held by the supreme court of india in *madras bar association vs union of india* (2020) where they stated that, “dispensation of justice by the tribunals can be effective only when they function independent of any executive control: this renders them credible and generates public confidence”. further, the dpdpb, 2023, like its predecessor, only provides adjudicatory powers to the dpb. here, it is essential that the dpb should also be tasked with regulatory powers that previous iterations of the data protection legislation in 2019 and 2021 tasked the data protection authority with. this will also be keeping in line with supervisory authorities across various jurisdictions which enjoy both adjudicatory and regulatory powers. one positive change which has been made is that the salary, allowances and other terms and conditions of service of the chairperson and other members can not be varied to their disadvantage after their appointment.

**e. appeals process revised**

the dpdpb, 2023 denotes the telecom disputes settlement and  appellate tribunal established under section 14 of the telecom regulatory authority of india act, 1997 as the appellate tribunal to which appeals against the decisions of the dpb will lie. it is unclear why this change has been made and how the telecom disputes settlement and  appellate tribunal was selected specifically.

### recommendations

the dpdpb, 2023 reiterates the shortcomings of the dpdpb, 2022 and fails to inculcate several of the meaningful recommendations that had been made during the consultation process which were subsequently made public by the relevant stakeholders. we strongly urge the union government to address the numerous recurring problems with successive iterations that have been raised by civil society stakeholders.

in its present form, the dpdpb, 2023 does not sufficiently safeguard the right to privacy and must not be enacted. there must be meaningful discussion and debate on the draft bill in the parliament, including a referral to an appropriate committee which may further seek public inputs in the course of its deliberations to re-architect the bill such that it protects citizens’ privacy from private entities as well as state instrumentalities.

we will continue to monitor the developments around the dpdpb, 2023 and publish further analysis to raise public awareness around our concerns with the draft.

reddit,2023-08-07 13:32:27,"rental flat trouble i rented out a 1bhk unfurnished apartment in april. everything seemed okay in the beginning.

***1.. termite infestation on walls***

then i noticed a big termite infestation problem that had covered an entire room's wall and doorframe. landlord sent one of his local guys to check the issue and he came empty-handed and emptied my entire can of termite spray but didn't do anything further. now, after a month again the termites have come back. landlord agreed to get pest control done because this isn't just some furniture getting infested, an entire wall is gone. but even with this, there's been significant delay either because i've been away or the landlord's been out of the city.

***2. seepage &amp; wall paint***  
then after all the rains, the ceiling of the bathroom and kitchen started having major seepage. the walls are all swollen and chunks of paint are falling off. the same local person checked it out and said ""*ye kuch nahi hai. sookh jayega*."" (this is nothing. it will dry off.)

***3. water motor***  
there's only one supply of water to the house and that is through the water motor which i need to run in the morning and evening. i first faced an issue in july and even then the landlord refused to do anything. (his father had passed away and so had gone to the village. i didn't want to be disrespectful to a grieving person so i booked motor repair service from urbancompany). the person who came to fix the motor said that it will run temporarily but if again there's an issue then the whole motor will have to be opened up. in july at least the motor was switching on. just that there was no water going up. this time, the motor itself isn't getting switched on. the digits aren't moving.  
called up the landlord again and he says ""*toh main kya kar sakta hun? maine toh isko working condition mein diya tha*."" (so what can i do about it? i gave it to you in working condition.) he also says that he got the binding work done in november last year so how can it get spoilt so fast. i asked for bills of the work done and he says he doesn't have any and this work doesn't have any guarantee anyway.

my rental deed says i have until the 5th of every month to pay. but even if i miss paying on 1st by a day they immediately call up. for this, they are super quick but to solve the above issues they make it seem like they're doing me a favor. he even remarked saying that when he handed over the house it didn't have termites but he will still get it done anyway. he's out of the city for 15 days so he can't even come look at the place. he's someone who works as a contractor. he has 3 other flats in the same area that i am in supposedly. he doesn't live in delhi. he lives in greater noida.

i have always lived in furnished places where i've never faced such a thing. i don't know what to do about it. i have a lock-in period of 8 months as per my rental deed.

i can't spend on fixing the motor right now.

what would you do if you were in my situation?"

about a month ago, a homeowner (fancy-ass independent house) asked me not to park where i usually do, because it's opposite his place and he usually parks his second car there. i very politely told him that it's a public road, and that the only way i'm not allowed to park there is if it's right in front of his gate or there's a no parking sign (the road is always lined with cars to one side, always has been, never a problem.) there is no way this obstructs his gate.

the guy's now gone and put up a parking barricade of his own there, and he keeps it on the footpath when he parks there (props to his effort, must say!) but i'm pretty sure this is illegal - i just don't know what to do about it. is there a way to report this?

victory, victory, victory to you!

\[ notes: the last part is self evident. there is some problem translating the *uchchala jaladhi taranga.* that refers to what i have written, but a more literal word will be ""pronounce"" (same base as *uccharan: pronunciation*) so in translation, the ocean (*jaladhi*) waves (*taranga*) are pronouncing (*uchchala*) the places within india. but, also, there is an instrument called *jal taranga*, a percussion instrument of water bells, and the poet is calling the indian ocean the jal taranga that sings of the lands that make up the indian subcontinent. this is lost in any translation.

he implies that india is god's own epic of victory, sung by the waves of the ocean.

is tagore referring to a god? yes, of course he is. if you've read gitanjali, or most other poems of his, he definitely believed in a god. but, it is much closer to a spinozan god than anything any religion would recognize. his is the god of the forests, of the red soil of jharkhand and bengal, of the white peaks of the himalayas, of birds and beasts. tagore was a nature poet, so you can almost substitute his ""god"" for ""nature"".

therefore, the anthem is saying that the indian subcontinent (yes, he is talking about the subcontinent. tagore was not keen on bombastic displays of nationalism {read fascism}) is an epic of nature's victory.

and, it is. i once stood in a forest in the shadow of the great peaks of the himalayas, and then it hit me all of a sudden, in that early morning sun catching the peaks, red and white and black, that it took 77 million years for this continent to make its way from antarctica and smash into the eurasian plate, in its way consuming another entire continent and an ocean. and there i stood in the folded crust, which 55 million years ago would have been underwater. what sort of power pushes rocks up to 7000m?

that when the national anthem popped in my head.

same thing when you stand on the deccan plateau (that's all lava from 65million years ago, some lava flows are 1500km long), or on the flower fields of munnar (ancient mountain system linked to the mountains in south america and africa, from 600 million years ago).

after heavy raining that took place days before, a lot of streets were flooded because of poor drainage system which affected the transportation and caused a lot of problems to the people in locality
water even entered our house it caused a lot of damage to us and people of our locality
we all were left to manage all of this by our self and the people from legeslative and executive bodies didn't care
in the open field beside us water collected and now it's a hub of flies 
after waiting for days now our neighbours are forced to themselves clear up the field as it is now posing sanitation and health issues 


what is the point of voting in this country when no one comes to help us in need
neither media held these people accountable
we are always left stranded with no help from authorities 
ps:this is my first post on reddit after getting repeatedly troubled and having no help even not a single word from authorities i decided to pen down this post . there has been no word and assurance of help from our elected representative"

as per the most recent submissions of goi and mohfw before the honourable supreme court, covid-19 vaccination was said to be voluntary no one can be forced to take vaccination by threatening to terminate him from their job, restrict access to public spaces and/or impose prohibitive costs of performing tests or procedures upon him.

considering this did bbmp issue any guidelines to employers to check for vaccination status? can anyone share any recent official guidelines issues by bbmp or gok regarding this?

reddit,2023-08-18 16:43:21,"how solving a minor issue could help india's growth as an entrepreneur for the past 3 years, i have faced a lot of difficulties with power cuts and the inadequate services provided by banks as i have had to do frequent transactions for work reasons. this has caused me to ponder on the recent boast about the growth of the indian economy. i am not disputing the fact that it has grown, but i strongly believe that it could have been much greater had these small issues been dealt with. that is why i have undertaken to research how solving the power cuts could help india. before you read this, i want to make it clear that i am neither a modi proponent nor a congress supporter.

i have tended to avoid politics as far as possible, however, i have observed how prime minister modi's government has been claiming the progress of the economy and the congress party has not acknowledged it, or is opposing it ( doing the opposite) . i have a neutral viewpoint on this and i agree that our growth has been commendable, but it may have been even more remarkable if instead of focusing on the bigger picture, if the government decided to pay attention to the minor details.

i ask all of you to consider my research regardless of your political leanings and to approach it with an open mind.

this research post examines the effects of resolving power cut issues on economic growth across the world. by investing in power infrastructure, countries have seen multiple positive outcomes, such as economic growth, industrialization, and quality of life improvements, in addition to avoiding power outages. we explore the historical evidence of the impact of reliable electricity access on a country's gdp and economy.

in the 1970s, south korea took a bold step towards economic success by increasing their power supply. this resulted in a dramatic 1-2% rise of their gdp annually. the access to uninterrupted electricity gave them the ability to become a major player in the world economy. similarly, china's economic turnaround in the late 1990s was closely linked to their determination to solve their power supply issues. this hard work resulted in roughly a 1% increase of their gdp yearly, granting them access to the same level of success that south korea had achieved.

through a successful effort to reduce power outages by half, brazil was able to see an impressive 0.4% boost in gdp growth. this allowed the country to stabilize its economy and provide the necessary conditions for long-term growth. nigeria, on the other hand, is struggling with unreliable electricity supply. by fixing this problem, the nation would be able to unlock its hidden economic potential, leading to a potential increase of up to 3-4% in gdp growth each year, offering new opportunities to its citizens.

in summary, it is evident that secure electricity supply has a direct correlation with a country's economic development. although the percentage of the impact may vary due to various circumstances, the overall result is that resolving power issues can yield substantial benefits. industries prosper, innovation soars, and citizens experience a better quality of life. as countries continue to develop and modernize, a reliable power supply is a fundamental factor in promoting long-term economic success.

after coming to bengaluru in last november the hairfall started. and it's a lot. i thought i had some issues genetically (my father is 55 but still has lots of hair) but it seems all my friends who came here are having hair loss issues. i guess it's either the water change or maybe my pg uses low quality ingredients for food.

i m sure it's not stress, i m chilled af most of the time. 

anyone experiencing the same problem and how did you fix it? any doctors with some advice? if you're not one of them please upvote so this gets more visibility

also, i want to tell that the city is lit and i m not hating on the city. just getting a bit anxious about my hair loss.

reddit,2023-08-20 16:35:39,"my first day and second day in bengaluru day before yesterday was my first day i spent in bangalore as an adult , i have been here before when i was 14.

now i felt i need a change in my life , so i wanted to move to bangalore , so i came to look for jobs and give my cv.

i felt the city so energetic , every person around were so wholesome. everyone around me were happy and smiling , i was so much excited to be in bangalore.

so much youngsters from various parts of the nation , the culture was unique i travelled whole day in bus only from marathahalli to malleswaram , then to bommasandra , then to bileshivale and back to marathahalli

i got to meet many people and had  wholesome conversations with local uncles 

and the bus conducter marked that she didnt give 5 rs change , i thought its like a coupon so i can get discount in next bus but other conducter didnt even respond me when i asked.

weather was so nice that day compared to my place , and finding the bus in majestic was hard too .

i went back to pg after tiring travel and slept peacefully , 


second day i had an interview and i went , and to my surprise even security person was so fluent in english , we became good friends.

later that day i had my train , my friend took me to a kerala restaurant in bellandur , i had to carry my trolley on my lap, sitting as a pillion.
 
i had my train at k.r.puram , my friend didnt know routes properly , he missed the u turn and we went over benniganahalli bridge , we went close to 3 kms for the u turn

while returning back from there i never realised my day is going to face a u turn , from all the happy faces , joyful vibes of bangalore amidst the traffic.

my friend was guilty of not knowing the routes and i might have missed my train because of it , so he panicked a bit.

he was filtering through the traffic and when finally when we reached an open strech......

my trolley's wheel which i was holding on my lap , hit on an ola scooter person's handle
i realised it was about to hit and i tried to move it a little , but still it hit his hand , i waved him telling a sorry.

but that man was furious , he started chasing animatedly , screaming at us , my friend didnt realise it until i told him the situation.

that person came close to us and showered hindi bad words at us thinking we are north indian , but iam tamil

my friend slowed down the bike to speak and the person tried to push us down , we lost balance somehow my friend managed and stopped 

that person stepped down screaming at my friend and tried to slap him , i intervened and 
told him it was my fault , but he was not ready to listen 

he was so anxious that he might have died , but that was not so bad of a collision , it was minor , and he tried to tell in tamil to us that he have kids and family.

i understood his emotion and felt bad and also realised the psychological effect of being in so much traffic , road rage.

he exaggerated the situation so much out of the anxiety i think.

and i my friend was so pissed and had a thought its common in bangalore when riding with tamilnadu registered vehicle , which i have heard in many incidents 

but this was not like that and explained my friend not to have such a negative mindset which makes us feel insecure .

that person left and later i realised it was not the trolley wheel which hit his handle, it was my hand and i stumbled on that man's brake handle and i was bleeding.

we reached k.r.puram station after all the hassle , we had a cup of tea and we were happy that we didnt escalate the problem . 

we both were so raged at the beginning wanted to fight that person , as that man confronted us when it was him who came and hit my hand , 

but during the arguement i realised that person was unaware of what happened , even i was not sure what happened all of a sudden

and my advice to anyone facing such issue dont plan to fight , just let them vent out verbally and leave, its better than arguing or fighting the person , which is not worth it

after having two contrasting days , i left the city with a smile .

once i get some vacancy in job i will move.

i wanted to share my experience , and would love to hear similar situations , and how you faced it ?"
reddit,2023-08-24 13:56:54,"how our house got robbed this is an old story, but just sharing it now here since i discovered reddit recently. slightly long post but might be a fun read.

this happened sometime in 2019 right before covid started.
so me and my roomates used to live in a 3 story building in kasturi nagar.
those matchbox type houses where you share your wall with the next house: vertically big but not much space depth wise or height wise.

so the house layout was like: kitchen + hall in the ground floor,
two bedrooms in the second floor and one bedroom and terrace in the top floor.

2 of us were staying in the top floor bedroom and rest of my friends were in the first floor.

so we both were away at our native, so our bedroom was just latched from outside on this particular night.

usually we have a cook akka who comes and makes food for us and leaves at night closing the main door (not locking it) just closing it.

our area usually had street lights, but for the past three four months two of the main street lights died and outside our house was pitch darkness. we complained to bbmp and was waiting for it to get fixed.

so on this fateful night, my other roomates after eating dinner looked at the main door and assumed it was locked (note: it's never locked by the cook). they went to their respective rooms locked it from inside and was doing their own leisure activities and they slept off.

next day morning, they were waken upto a dog inside the house and garbage piled up in the ground floor hall and staircase.

one of my friend thought, oh shit, we forgot to latch the door and dogs somehow got in carrying all the garbage. he spent all morning cleaning up everything. once he was done, he thought let me make my morning tea/coffee for all the hardwork he did.

first the stove lighter was missing, he found a matchbox to light and came back, turned the stove on and tried lighting, it was not turning on.
opened the draws under the counter top to realize the gas cylinder was gone. 

now we come to the realization we were robbed. :|

so what happened is since it's pitch dark outside and we have the habit of leaving the lights on in the ground floor throughout night as people come and go at random times. so due to some wind or something, the main door which was not locked flung open and the light in the ground floor was shining. like a beacon to the road in front of the house inviting all potential robbers inside.


as you can expect our ground floor was practically empty as you would expect in a bachelor pad, just some random old chairs and some locked cycles and some kitchen utility like a fridge and utensils.

out of all this only our gas cylinder got stolen ( or so we thought).


so i came back from native, saw the situation and asked my friend regarding two amazon packages that said it was delivered. apparently those also got stolen, but that was okay it was some 200 rupee bath mats.

the funny thing is after one week, our cook akka comes and tells us, can you bring the mixie you have stored in your room, its been hard to cook curries without it. we were like why would we store mixie in our rooms, to come to the realization our mixie was also stolen. 😂

we didn't even realize.


the kicker to all this was, after one month of this incident, i asked my friend in the first floor to come running with me to become more fit.
he was searching for his beloved pair of running shoes that he kept in the common area of the first floor (he didn't keep outside the house, so that no one should take it, and it shouldn't get dirty) and realized that was also stolen 😂. poor guy was cursing the thief, he had kept his shoes very carefully.

then we came to the realization that the thief had actually climbed to the second floor, realized both the bedrooms were locked and went back. if he had just climbed one more floor, our room was just latched and it could have been ransacked. lucky us somehow.

after this it was pretty horrifying at night ( for the first few weeks after the incident. just came across another post about iron rod sound at 12:30 am). we used to hear footsteps outside our house around 1am and since it was pitch dark, we could never know if people were really there. we left the place long back. the house was filled with problems since day 1 and thankfully we all are at a better place now. 😂"
reddit,2023-08-27 10:41:07,"the multitude of versions of your life as one grows up and makes decisions. &amp;#x200b;

i was thinking about how much our indian's career is mostly prewritten. furthermore, your life could change unexpectedly no matter how much you try to control it. it's important i guess, not to think too much about your past decisions

\---------------------------------------------------------- 

i see life branching out from a particular position in different directions, just like in a road. often, these roads are entirely different and lead to dissimilar journeys; you are always determining where it will lead. you can only pick one and observe the other road while riding alone. at some point, that road is no longer visible to your eye. it is replaced permanently with self-doubt. what if i had taken the other direction? would my journey have been any different? that is the least of the problems, as one doesn't realize further down the road, there is another road where you may have to choose which direction to pick; there is little time to regret your past decision because, again, you have some selection to do  
.  
we could always be carefully choosing the roads right?, well we could, but often decisions in life seem equally enticing, and not one road seems substantially more attractive than another; in that case, you pick a road listening to your gut feeling and limited information you have hoping the decision won't come to bite you eventually. 

however, nothing brings more mournfulness. that leads you to forcefully pick up a road because of the events that transpired suddenly. maybe everything is going right for some time, and then because of the world's chaos, the road you are in splits in, too, leading to a place you don't want to go. still, you can't help it; you are just forever looking at that road that could have been easily avoided if things had gone right for those seconds. 

keeping track of the events of life that could have transpired it's hard and quickly becoming overwhelming, all we can do is trust in our journey that hopefully leads to somewhere that gives you some peace in the world."

reddit,2023-08-31 10:47:30,"akasa air review: read this before booking your next flight so i booked a round trip akasa air flight around 2 months ago from bangalore to kochi.

one day prior, i had tried web check-in but their up portal said web check-in time not started yet.

i'm a very organized person so i reach the airport around 3 hours before and i entered the airport, placed by bags on the check-in counter and the lady smiles and says, sir your flight is cancelled. please go to akasa air counter over there.

so i go to their counter and the guy over there says your flight was cancelled due to operational reasons, we tried calling you but your line was busy.

in a state of shock i ask them wtf, did you send an email or sms? dude is confidently saying yes. i told him it's impossible, i check my email and sms and nothing.

i ask him what time did you send email show me. he's like that we can't share but we have sent.

i argue with him that there is no such communication and i ask him to put me on a next flight. he's saying there are no more flights, they will offer refund and i can leave the airport.

by this time another 4 people also show up with the same issue including an old couple, a young couple with an infant and one guy coming from canada.

to all of us, these people are saying same thing, there is nothing they can do and we should leave the airport.

at this point i start arguing with him and he's like show me me your phone i will show you the email and sms we sent.

i gave him my phone and he checks and finds so such information from airline. i was thinking in my mind, the audacity of this airline to cancel the flight then accusing me of lying.

so he says let's see what i can do and he just flees the scene. after 2 hours of waiting i start shouting on the other guy at the counter and he also says there is nothing he can do.

by this time, the couple with infant gave up and booked another flight at some 10k and left.

i argue that they have to compensate me or book another flight and the guy at counter says to wait.

i wait another hour and he says there's an indigo flight at 12 30 he'll try to book me on it.

i keep waiting and then after 30 mins says there is no ticket on that he'll try to get me on a flight at 2 20 p.m.

i keep waiting, till this time they don't even offer a glass of water and asks to keep waiting.

around 1 o clock, i'm at my wits end and starts shouting on them and goes around the airport looking for the guy who promised the alternate flight.

finally, i find him, scream at him and he gets a ticket for all 4 of us on indigo at 2 20 pm.

i'm generally a nonconfrontational guy but the sheer negligence and indifference of this guy got me extremely worked up. another thing i understood from this experience is that in india, nobody gives a tiny shit about other people's time, commitments or needs. only if you raise your voice there is some hope for any action from these messed up service providers.

finally boarded the flight and took off.

previously i had flown akasa, never had a problem and have even recommended the same to people-but never again. indigo has been late, but they have never cancelled a flight without telling me.

this post is for general awareness so that other people can avoid experiencing such a shit airline."
reddit,2023-08-31 11:30:11,"adieu delhi, my beloved mess hey there, fellow redditors,

i've got a story to share, and it's about my relationship with delhi, a city i've called home for the past 10 years. after what happened last night on my way to bangla sahib gurudwara, i just can't keep it to myself.
here's the backstory: i frequently travel for work, and i returned on the 29th, just in time to celebrate raksha bandhan with my family. to make the evening special, i decided to take them to bangla sahib gurudwara at 10:30 pm. little did i know what awaited us.

first things first, this is a city that's about to host the g20 summit, but as i drove through the ghanta ghar wala stretch, i couldn't help but wonder if i had landed in a post-apocalyptic warzone. potholes that could swallow a small car, stray cattle roaming like they owned the place, and cars parked in the most inconsiderate ways, blocking the entire road.

but the real kicker was what happened on that very stretch. out of nowhere, a guy decides it's the perfect moment to swing his car door open right in front of me. i slammed the brakes just in time to avoid a collision, but this dude? he nonchalantly walks away without a hint of remorse. seriously, delhi, where's the decency?

and then, on the rani jhansi flyover, as i'm driving well within the speed limits, a biker starts playing some bizarre game with me. flashing his lights, honking like a maniac, and then overtaking me just to block my path in a petty act of revenge. it's like road rage has become the city's national sport.

but the cherry on top was the return journey. drunk folks causing a ruckus, people engaging in street fights – it was like a scene from a dystopian movie.

i've had it, folks. i've traveled all around india, and i can't believe i'm saying this, but delhi, you've officially earned the title of ""worst city"" in my book. the city that was once brimming with life and culture has lost its soul. it's like watching a dear friend slowly self-destruct.
i can't stand idly by and watch this city crumble any longer. so, here's the big news – i've decided to pack my bags and bid farewell to this urban jungle. delhi, it's been a ride, but it's time for me to find a new home.

thanks for letting me vent, reddit. it's therapeutic to share my frustration with you all."

2. some of the population won't even be living in bangalore if it was permanent wfh

reddit,2023-09-17 23:31:49,"inverter issues and bescom ? has anyone in bangalore faced an issue where a home inverter does not provide backup when power is out but if we cut off the line (by turning off the switch) that feeds into the inverter from mains (even though there's no power in the entire building) the inverter starts working and the battery powers the home ? it was happening consistently when i was staying in marathalli but ever since i moved to hsr layout, it happens sometimes but not always. i've had to replace two hard drives because of this and am at my wits end trying to figure out why this is happening.

anyone got an idea why this might be happening ? i only have two theories

1. when there's a power shutdown, power is not switched off completely and maybe there's a few volts still coming in so maybe the inverter thinks power is still available and does not provide backup.
2. maybe bescom swaps live and neutral from time to time and that somehow confuses the inverter ?  

somehow this doesn't happen when i manually cut off the line that goes from mains to the inverter (again by turning off the switch) when power is still on, so i'm not even able to demonstrate this problem to the service technician. they come over, turn off the switch and it works just fine and they leave saying there's no issue."

pardon me for cussing. i don't usually, but i'm very frustrated today. and not typing full form because i don't want any trouble in future. 


started with this. 
went to adhr office to change address, first we went to know about the documents that are required to go on with process. 
assistant said current bill and adhr is needed.
when we showed up with those after two days, waited 1.5hrs in queue and then the workers in counter said anything except current bill works, example gas bill and house documents. so we also enquired what else is need, they said we need some officers stamp for it. who is in different area.

so today we went and got officers stamp and all, then they said photo has name on bottom so it isn't valid, and they said it is mentioned in three points at the end of page. (no, it wasn't mentioned) and it was almost closing time for working. so we rushed to fill another form and accidentally got one point work so we scribbled on it and asked the same worker if it is valid or not, he just said it is, while looking at phone. 
so we went to officer again to get the stamp who is in different area center. and after we came back, the lady in counter was about to accept it but this same assistant stopped it and freaking said that it has one word scribbled on it so it wasn't valid. when we told him that we asked all this before but he said its okay, he replied saying maybe we didn't understand it properly. 
so finally we had enough and raised our voice saying the other day he said current bill was enough when it wasn't even in requirements and now we asked him before going to that special officer stamp and he said okay. why is he changing his words, when none of our time or officers time is not easy to waste. why didn't he reply properly looking at the paper instead just kept looking at his phone instead. 
this got the attention of other workers in the counters and tables, so one of them said we can go and do it in internet center, they will do this. 
why didn't they say this before? we went to three places which used to do this work but nowadays they stopped doing it and this main center was our only option so we kept coming to this. 

i know when there is something that troubled us and irritated us giving frustration, everything else also feels frustrating but it's like the when the day can't get any worse, it proves wrong and keep getting even worse. read next part

all related to people driving, only two wheelers mostly today. 
1. while taking turn to street, my car tire got stuck in this small space between two ya'know drainage stones? between that. i admit this, i was reckless and was taking turn fast so couldn't see it. as the space was very small and my small car tire unfortunately was enough to get stuck there. no car bigger than mine, or my tire will be able to get stuck in there. so i had to get it back. (this was my poor estimation of turning and frustration driving turn, no living brings were harmed. only the poor stones and my tires, so i admit it's my fault and i'm guilty)

2. the road was not really that big but still people park their stupid two wheelers for a famous tiffin tea place, occupying half of the road. this is main road btw. not some street fyi. this is busy evening time, i understand but they could at least part it in line where it doesn't take up half of the road which is basically one way line. 

3. as this isn't enough for today, while driving car. one biker while looking at phone was taking turn to street in wrong way, coming in front of my car not paying attention to road. so i honked twice to get his attention and he fucking looked at me as if i'm strange. not just him, a lot of two vehicles drivers use phone while driving and the vehicle isn't balanced, they aren't even in edge of road, no, they like to put their ass in middle of the line and go super slow and wobbly. 

4.and then another biker asshole took sudden turn to right without signals and the turn was just 2 feels distant so i had to give sudden break and then the scooty behind me crashed into my car, why the fuck scooty behind didn't even leave 1ft distance? 
i'm used to no signal turns, this is india i know. but why the hell take turn on the side that we already half passed? they could've drove 10steps forward and there is another u-turn there. 

5. and this also reminds me in afternoon today, there were only two cars on road including mine and one asshole kept hocking behind me when there is no other vehicle in our line so i gave him the way to pass by me but he didn't take that as well and he didn't honk when other vehicles came in our line later. 

fucking pricks, fucking certain system and it's workers. fuck everything here. and no, unfortunately i have no plans of leaving this shithole... yet or anytime soon at least. 
the day still has 5hrs left, let's see if it'll get even more worse. yeah, challenge me you stupid freaking day. fuck everything.

and this is on next day, usually it will just take 2 mins to cross this street. but today it took 25mins. 
there was some lunch event happening under tent in one place on main road line, all the guests who came for that just basically parked their bikes on half of the one way road path, hence all the traffic is blocked. they also parked their bikes in streets on both sides leaving no space for any car in middle to drive. 

they could've parked in streets next to it in one side, which wouldn't give any traffic problem at all. but no, they all like to keep bikes near them so they don't have to move their lazy ass. 
and when a lorry was coming in front of us, the two wheelers kept trying go straight in front of it and then were trying to put their butt in between the cars where there is no space. they could've just not come in this line when they saw it's stuck, but no, they like to die in front of some bigger vehicle one day. not wishing bad on anyway. just saying."
reddit,2023-09-28 17:44:32,"are you with me as a native of bangalore who never want to live there anymore? my family on both sides have settled in bangalore over 3 generations before and starting from my grandparents there is hardly anyone we can call family outside of the city. 

i've moved abroad years ago but i visit bangalore atleast 4 times a year to see family. now have some work flexibility and with old parents, we live the european winter in india and rest of the time in europe. 

given that most of my parents generation of family will no longer be alive in 10-15 years, i can't think of any reason to actually come back to the city given it's current state. 

i see people discussing so many short term solutions like wfh, public transport over individuals in cars, etc. none of them seem actually possible to be implemented without underlying incentives changing  (e.g. a small % of corporate tax reduction for companies providing wfh, etc). politicians will only look to implement laws to collect more taxes and care fuckall about anything else. corporates care about their balance sheet and would make people work permanently from office if they think that's how to extract productivity for profits. ultimately, people are fucked over by everyone. 

given the problems of climate change of heavy rains and drinking water problems, i see no respite. bangalore will continue to receive massive immigration given the job opportunities and expansion of the city beyond the airport.

every time i visit nowadays, a little bit of resentment builds given how people are suffering productivity given the state.

i just cannot connect with the city anymore and have to protect my good memories against the pain of getting shit done. 

most of my cousins and younger relatives already live abroad. i can't imagine ever living in the city after the inevitable of our families fading away. 

i'm wondering how many native bangaloreans get the same feeling?"
reddit,2023-10-05 06:49:30,"22yo from assam to germany on a solo-trip: things and ideas i learnt and carried back with me as of writing this, it’s been a week since i’ve returned from germany. i thought of penning down my thoughts as soon as i got home, only to surrender my body and mind to a high fever that lasted three nights. i was seven thousand kilometres away from naharkatia, wandering around on bicycles in munich, a city of pleasant weather, fresh air, helpful people, and lots of beer. amongst the new sceneries and a changeless smile, one thought remained constant though:

*what will i take back home?*

i didn’t care about leather bags, expensive perfumes, or century-old wine as many might consider these worth bringing back home. souvenirs, so to say. sure i could’ve gotten all that given i purchased another suitcase and squashed a lot of things into it, only to excruciate my spine.

instead, i decided to excruciate my brain.

i decided on bringing back **ideas,** millions of them, **perspectives,** felt by touch and seen through a million lenses, and **hope**, for better changes.

below are a few things i observed in germany that, i believe, are great. things we can learn and adapt in naharkatia or any small town in india:

if you care about such ideas, support my work by typing in your email. that’s it. thank you and i hope you have a great time reading this.

## clean environment (civic sense)

when a person finishes eating chips, they don’t throw the packet on the streets. they throw it in the nearest dustbin. and if they can’t find one, they quite elegantly fold the packet, put it in their pocket/bag, and take it home.

when people in germany finish drinking any liquid from a plastic bottle(although a lot of stores sell glass bottles, about which we’ll talk soon), they keep the bottle with them to put it in a recycle dustbin, exchange it at the store for 0.25 euros, or take it home. we don’t need to be german residents to know that the plastic bottle can be reused in many ways. as a hanging flower pot, a toothbrush holder, maybe an ashtray? imagination is the limit.

people don’t spit on the roads and litter around throwing gutkha packets everywhere. because they don’t have that. they do, however, throw around a lot of cigarette butts but larger packets and trash, barely.

**“but there are no dustbins in naharkatia. where will we dispose of the trash?”**

take the trash home. at least then, it will be collected and disposed of at one particular location instead of painting the entire town in scattered garbage.

“i see a pile of garbage already here. i can throw my garbage here, right? since it’s in one particular place, it’ll be easier for the municipality to clean?”

you see, if there’s a lot of human shit somewhere, all piled up, you shouldn’t climb a ladder to shit on it. if someone else is a buffoon, doesn’t mean you should nourish them a competition. after all, it’s our own planet. i’m sorry for being preachy and prophet-like, but **not throwing garbage on the streets** doesn’t need a highly educated or intellectual person. just a person with good intentions and a sense of love and respect for the planet will do.

## humans and bicycles over cars

have you ever turned your head ninety times before crossing the road? constantly checking if a car is getting close enough to smash you? the people in these cars and motorcycles live by two divine principles:

“one, i own the road. i won’t let anyone else stop me from speeding to death.”

“two, i will keep smashing the horn every nanosecond so the entire population knows i exist.”

that seldom happens in germany. at least, i didn’t see anything similar during my thirteen-day stay.

roads have a strong hierarchy. footpaths are everywhere, even across the main city roads. so are cycle lanes. you can partake in your daily commutes through a cycle and even explore the entire city on one. most roads have dedicated cycle lanes where cars don’t drive, and people don’t walk. it’s strictly for cycles.

**and we can do that in naharkatia too!**

no, we don’t need to extend the roads to build dedicated cycle lanes. that’d be way too expensive and way too difficult for us to convince the authorities. instead, we can decrease the parking spaces in the main town for four-wheelers and encourage more and more people to wander around the town in their cycles. just draw lines across the roads and call it a cycle lane. don’t allow cars to drive on it, and you have a safe runway for cycles. at least people shouldn’t find the excuse of “it’s very unsafe” for not riding cycles.

cycling has a lot of benefits; it’s healthy, doesn’t require fuel, so no pollution, costs less, so fewer car loans, and creates a safe environment on roads. your chances of dying in a cycle-to-cycle accident are minimal.

i, myself, drive the car a lot. even to go to our office within the town, i take the car. why? i didn’t care much about these things until i gave them some thought. so, here are a few things that may have let me drive the car:

1. **easy.** of course, driving a car feels easier with the ac on and some nice songs playing. but i’ve realised i’m just a lazy prick who doesn’t want to walk or cycle.
2. **the roads.** whenever it rains, our allupatty road becomes a canal. you can swim, and row a boat, but you can not walk. i mean you can, but the clogged water’s from the rain and the drain. so, you better not.
3. **i don’t own a cycle.** that’s something i never thought about. i don’t own a cycle, hence i never ride one. and i never cared because taking out the car was so easy.

all of these must change. of course, i can’t build the roads and nor will the authorities as they do not care, but walking or cycling must be adapted. even not, hiring a tuk-tuk helps. tuk-tuks are electric, pays for someone’s food, are much cheaper than owning a bicycle or a car, and are widely available across the town.

we’d need proper roads too, with minimal potholes, without giant fishing ponds in between them, and better if evenly surfaced. but since we don’t have that power, authority, or unity to pressurise the local authorities, we’ll shut up and keep doing what’s possible for us.

## cabs are murderously expensive; take public transport instead

answer this. in how many ways can you reach dibrugarh from naharkatia?

train, very well. buses, okay. wingers, magics, and other such vehicles, alright.

now, how many of these buses, wingers, and magics are provided by the government? and why, even in 2023, can’t we find a vehicle after 3 p.m. from dibrugarh to naharkatia? why is connectivity so bad?

the only answer i can think of is that we have never thought about it or we’re so desensitised towards it we barely notice. and even if we have noticed, we didn’t care much to talk about it and adapt our mantra of, “eh, baad de aaru."" (ah, just let it be).

when i talk about cleanliness in germany, people say it’s a small country with a small population. hence, there’s less trash. *cool.* but their small country has extensive public transport facilities. and our towns and cities in assam are quite small. so, an effective public transport infrastructure is possible, right? *“nah, our towns are too small.”*

***waa-owww.***

sure, i’m not demanding trams(although that’d be pretty cool, but impractical). i’m just demanding frequent buses and trains, provided or facilitated by the government, with strict hygiene policies, hefty fines on whoever defers, and good suspensions. since our roads are similar to mars’ surface, at least we can ask for better suspensions so we don’t break our hips and backs.

good public transport infrastructure immediately means fewer cars, less pollution, a lot less honking, and safer roads for pedestrians and cycles. but again, not something we can privately build.

cars are expensive there, and so are related taxes. cabs are murderously expensive because they have a smaller population so the wages are high, but also because they encourage you to take public transport. but if you’re rich enough, well, get broke for a ten-minute ride.

## water bottles come in glass, not plastic

that’s a misleading statement, but it sounded better for the headline. plastic water bottles are available too, but i’ve seen a lot of water being sold in glass bottles too. why?

1. **tap water is drinkable across the country.** this means the water from any of the taps in your home is safe, treated, and drinkable. i mean, how cool is that?
2. **plastic is bad for the environment.** since tap water is drinkable and easily accessible, buying water doesn’t make much sense, except still and sparkling waters which can still be bought. but water does come in glass bottles. glass recycles better than plastic.
3. **return plastic bottles for cash.** when you buy a coca-cola, they charge you extra 0.25 euros for the bottle. once you finish drinking the poison, you can go and return the bottle to the store and get back your 0.25 euros.
4. **again, tap water is safe to drink.** that’s crazy.

access to safe drinking water is still a luxury for millions across the globe. and germany or the netherlands have worked excessively towards safe drinking water. i didn’t see any ros or water purifiers in apartments or hotels. at one of the holiday inn hotels, i checked into my room only to find out there were no complimentary water bottles. usually, you find two in radisson blu hotels across india. more than anything, i was confused. “did they forget to restock the water?”, i thought to myself. “maybe it was a mistake. let me call them.”

i called them and they said they don’t provide complimentary water bottles. i named the hotels because both chains are high-end, expensive hotels. no water bottles. then they told me the water from the tap is safe, drinkable, and tasty too. 

i was afraid to taste the tap water in germany as i’ve had a sour experience(literally and psychologically) at radisson, faridabad where the water feels like 100% pure ocean water with 0% treatment or effort. but i tasted it. and it was really good. you could, of course, tell tap water and bottled water by their tastes and little nuances in the tongue, but regardless, tap water is easily drinkable.

imagine if that happens in india. over \[two lakh people won’t lose their lives every year\]([https://pib.gov.in/pressreleaseiframepage.aspx?prid=1807831#:\~:text=composite%20water%20management%20index%20(cwmi,of%20india%27s%20projected%20population%20by)](https://pib.gov.in/pressreleaseiframepage.aspx?prid=1807831#:~:text=composite%20water%20management%20index%20(cwmi,of%20india%27s%20projected%20population%20by)). to make things worse, over sixty crore people across our country may face issues regarding safe drinking water by 2030, which will then be around forty per cent of our total population. that’s pure horror and extremely sad.

## human resources and education; gems of the new world

after visiting munich, nuremberg(a lovely place with castles), dresden, and finally berlin, i found myself less excited and adventurous. maa contacted a few people and gave me the contact of pallab da. without much thought or planning, i packed my bags and took the train to delft from amsterdam, where i was temporarily stationing to check out the canals, the world-renowned cycling infrastructure, and a lot of herb exploration.

pallab da is a st. mary’s alumni who went on to become a prominent research scientist at iit kharagpur. he’s quite popular there, as well as tezpur and dibrugarh universities. he’s currently finishing his phd at delft university of technology (tu delft) and is working as a payload engineer.

we had hours and hours of discussions among other activities like cycling around delft, exploring local markets, shopping, cooking food(i am terrible at cutting vegetables and now he knows and so do you), and having deeply philosophical conversations about life, careers, and the dilemma of living abroad against coming back home.

he told me that his university has to pay a lot to retain him in the country and they do it rightly so as he’s a highly-skilled resource for them. most of his expenses are paid for and he earns quite handsomely to lead a life in the netherlands without having to worry about [the country entering a recession](https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/dutch-economy-enters-recession-as-inflation-bites-17543611.htm).

as i reached the delft central station, he came to welcome me and allowed me to be a guest of his for two nights. he commuted in a bus, and we went back the same way. public transport is abundant and extremely accessible in the netherlands as well.

in one of our conversations, i asked him what he thinks are we doing wrong in india. perhaps a lot of things. but one particular was retaining talent and human resources. european countries, maybe even america, would go to war to acquire highly skilled individuals as they consider these bunch important and crucial for the development of their countries. wages are fair, lifestyle brilliant, and most importantly, the opportunity to meet hundreds of like-minded people from all across.

anyone would say yes to such an opportunity in a heartbeat. would you not?

most of us would. but have we ever questioned why?

think about it. is grass actually greener on the other side or are we all hallucinating? what problems do we want to run away from in our country? will things get better there?

the answers will always be subjective and highly debatable but do look at facts while forming an opinion. facts aren’t right or wrong, they just exist.

whatever it is, i felt as if these european countries focus a lot on talents and human resources from across the globe and want to safeguard them in their countries. if the netherlands can realise the potential of pallab da, i’m sure an indian institute can too. the focus should be, for our country, is to first retain talents from within, pay them well, give them benefits, and an arena for exploration, research, and platforms for endless possibilities. and if resources allow, invite and welcome people from other countries too.

## in the end

pallab da threw light on two more interesting insights. first, he had aryabhatta’s portraits hanging on the walls of his home, hence, making the great mathematician one of his role models. we should really think about this. if our role models are scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, and/or people of authority who’re vocal about our issues instead of instagram celebrities, toxic gamers, or corrupt politicians, our trajectory of life would be really different.

second, if you want something to happen to you, the power’s all in you. make it happen. we oftentimes throw excuses like, “but my parents don’t understand”, “my parents don’t allow me”, “i don’t have the finances”, “studying abroad is expensive, simply unaffordable”, etc., think about the times you did things that our parents don’t allow. drinking alcohol, smoking, getting in fights at school, disrespecting others, gossiping and laughing at someone else’s expense, these are all things our parents *don’t allow* us to do, nor do they teach us. and yet we do them.

when i asked pallab da, “how do we change the mindset of these young talents’ parents?”, he said, “it is not the parent you should focus on, but the child. if the child has an inner fire so strong, the winds won’t extinguish it. they’ll only amplify it.”

from his journey of life, he was so dedicated and passionate about what he wanted to do, he barely took a penny from his family to make his dreams come true. 

*“you can’t convince your parents. you can just prove it to them.”*

prove your parents that you’re worthy. show results. bring accolades and societal validation. trust me, if you can conquer society, your parents will become your greatest supporters.

and those who feel you aren’t passionate about anything, remember, everyone is passionate about something. you just haven’t discovered it yet. try new things, and explore the million possibilities before locking yourself up in a discipline you seldom enjoy. the world is, after all, a stage.

and all of us, merely players.

reddit,2023-10-08 17:19:24,"farmers announce nationwide protests against the allegations made against the historic farmers' movement in the delhi police fir against newsclick **press statement | 8th october, 2023**

**skm to launch nationwide mass protests against bjp-rss led modi govt. for its renewed attack on farmers’ movement through newsclick fir**

**delhi, 8th october, 2023:** samyukt kisan morcha (skm) is shocked to learn about the scurrilous and malafide allegations made against the historic skm-led farmers’ movement at delhi, in the fir lodged by special cell of the delhi police against media house newsclick and several journalists. skm categorically rejects all allegations made in the fir against the farmers’ movement, the same being false and motivated, and unequivocally places on record that: 

1) skm rejects the patently false and mischievous allegations in the fir that the farmers’ movement was to ""disrupt supplies and services essential to the life of community in india, abet damage and destruction of property, cause huge loss to the indian economy and create internal law and order problems, through illegal foreign funding"". farmers, the annadatas of the nation, participated in a peaceful protest led by the skm against the anti-farmer and pro-corporate laws and policies of the bjp govt. no supply was disrupted by the farmers. no property was damaged by the farmers. no loss to the economy was caused by farmers. no law and order problem was created by the farmers. by violently stopping the farmers from exercising their democratic right of reaching the nation’s capital, through barbed wire fencing, water cannons, lathi charge and digging up roads, it is the union govt. that caused great inconvenience to the people of the nation and the farmers. farmers had to sit in protest for 13 long months, under the blazing summer sun, torrential rains and freezing winter cold. it is the union govt. and bjp-rss combine that created law and order problems by mowing down farmers at lakhimpur kheri under running vehicles, killing four farmers and one journalist. the union minister of state for home affairs and his son were behind this attack. till now the prime minister has not removed the delinquent minister and ensured legal action against the culprits. 735 farmers including lakhimpur kheri farmers had to sacrifice their lives to counter the repression by modi government. it is the govt. that destroyed public property. it is the govt. that conspired with crony capitalists to grab and capture food production and supply chains, destroying food security of the people and economy of the nation. funds from china have been received by pm modi in pm care fund and gautam adani in his business. the farmers’ movement succeeded, overcoming enormous hardship and with great sacrifice of the farmers. to belittle such sacrifice by alleging that the movement was foreign funded and acts of terrorism, betrays the arrogance, ignorance and anti-people mindset of the govt.

2) skm strongly denounces attempt by the bjp led union govt. to underplay the importance of the immensely patriotic and historic farmers' movement which was against this govt's attempt to hand over indian farming to big corporates including foreign exploiters. it is pertinent to mention that the 3 black farm laws tried to establish legal control of corporates over cropping pattern through contract farming, over mandis, over food processing and food distribution through the mandi act and modifications in the essential commodities act and to do away with govt. procurement, price support and pds ration security. that is why the laws were anti-people and unpatriotic while the farmers' movement was a spontenous expression of high degree of nationalism. this fir is a crafty and nefarious plan to portray the farmers' movement as funded by some extraneous sources, a ploy firmly rejected by the farmers’ movement during the course of the movement, and before which the modi led bjp-rss govt had been forced to surrender its fabricated claims. indian farming not only provides for food security to 142 crore people, it provides subsistence to 90 crore rural folk, the importance of which was seen by all during the corona pandemic.  

3) since delhi police is under the control of the union govt. and commanded by known anti-farmer leaders like prime minister narendra modi and home minister amit shah, it is not surprising that false allegations have been made against the farmers’ movement, though the extent of the falsehood is astounding. 

4) skm understands that the bjp led union govt., still smarting from the humiliation of having to roll-back the 3 black farm laws in the face of the determined, democratic and peaceful agitation of farmers at the borders of delhi from november 2020 to december 2021, will continuously try to take revenge against farmers by tainting the farmers’ movement and building an anti-farmer narrative. 

while the skm, through its constituent organisations, has already expressed solidarity with independent media houses like newsclick and scores of journalists who have the courage to write and publish the truth about this anti-people bjp led union govt. and denounced the nefarious attempts of the govt. to muzzle and choke their voices through false cases and arrests by illegal misuse of state machinery and power, the skm once again expresses solidarity with newsclick and all sections of the independent media and reiterates that it shall support all classes of citizens in ensuring that their rights are not trampled upon by this govt. 
   
skm announces nationwide mass protests against this bjp led union govt for its renewed attack on the farmers’ movement through the newsclick fir. every state capital, district head quarter, tehsil head quarter shall see mass protest gatherings demanding immediate withdrawal of the false and scurrilous allegations made against the farmers’ movement in the newsclick fir. memorandum shall be submitted by delegations of the skm leaders to the president of india, prime minster, union home minister, union agriculture minister and commissioner of delhi police to immediately withdraw all allegations against the farmers’ movement, failing which sit-in protests and demonstrations shall be held at the offices of all authorities."

the amount of filth, poor , polluted environment, inefficient waste management, poor hygiene levels, poor public transportation in vast majority of cities in india is staggering. even though i was born and raised in india but after spending last 6 years abroad and returning back i felt like i am 100 years behind. 

the only thing we are ahead right now is 
payment systems (cashless transaction) 
which is impeccable all over india. apart from that most cities are not livable for an average person. 

heck even cities in african countries are way better and clean. 

i have lived in pune, mumbai, hyderabad and bangalore. these cities are disgusting and builders have gone mad constructing building one after the other leaving no roads, no space for parking, potholes and whatnot.

i live in a pretty conjusted area with a lot of vehicle movement. cycling at anytime of the day is very difficult here.
at early mornings dogs are a very big problem. 9/10 dogs chase after a cycle, so cycling on cross roads is big no. if i go to the main roads, due to empty roads at the early mornings  all the vehicles will be speeding, and it scares the shit out of me when they pass just few metres next to me at 70+kmph. 

at evenings, the vehicle movement is so much that i will be honked, stared and cursed. two wheelers trying to overtake cars/bus from left side honk at me like anything when i am going on the left most side of road.  i don't know what do they expect when they honk at me, i can't even go to the side to give them space as i would be at the leftmost side."

reddit,2023-10-20 01:09:07,"india, why the double standard with ""freebies""? majority of developed countries provide free healthcare, free education, and often free public transport. these countries are hailed as advanced. due to these policies, people don't need to save as much money for a rainy day and instead spend more stimulating the economy, resulting in further growth. 

in india, any such action is called a ""freebie"" and looked down upon. in karnataka there is free public transport for women. sure, there is a cost associated with it. but are we so blind that we can't see the huge addition to the economy if millions of women go out and work instead of sitting at home? what is the problem with reducing the barrier to leave the home? 

it seems like a plague of the rich, privileged, city population to have a problem with such things, since they have neither experienced the challenges of not having it, nor the benefit of the government making an effort to provide.

edit, based on the discussion, in summary it seems:

1. the word ""freebie"" itself is politicised and disingenuous. the same concept is called ""welfare"" in many other countries and is hailed as positive.

2. even if it doesn't support them directly, people here support welfare. they only want it to be thought through economically. this is absolutely 100% a fair viewpoint!

3. there is a common misconception that 98% of india doesn't pay tax. and 2% of hard working tax payers are living miserable hard lives supporting the rest.

100% of this country pays tax. maybe not income tax, but on every purchase, on every food grain bought tax is paid. and if you think you're living a harder life than the 98% of the country that lives in poverty and often doesn't have food to eat, you're delusional. 

""oh but my uncle's friend's brother is a farmer who earns 100cr and doesn't pay tax"". yeah sure, but the point is about statistics. in general, farmers are poor, so in general they don't pay tax. policies in large scale are all about ""in general"". exceptional cases are bound to come up with large scale policies, but in general, it works. 

4. india is moving towards a system where people are demanding more basic services from government. this is not just free electricity and water, but also more development of roads, infrastructure, and environmental protection. this is good! 

yes there will be mistakes along the way, and some policies will undoubtedly fail. but on the whole, let's keep demanding better from policy makers, let's keep the criticism up, and we will push the government to do better. keep the pressure up guys, on both sides of the debate! 

debate is essential to democracy."
reddit,2023-10-22 11:22:45,"my friend got possessed i am a totally science person and i don't believe in ghosts and chudails. whatever happens there has to be some scientific reason behind it, that's what i believe. but what happened a year ago still stuck in my head so i thought that someone could give me an answer to it.

a year ago my friend (f) arrive at her home around 11 pm from work. her behavior was not normal. she went to corner of the house hid her face with her hairs sat cross legged on the floor. she was in the same position for an hour. when her family approached her she was not responding so her family called her cousin brother and her brother called me so we went together to her house. till we reach her house she somehow managed to pick up a knife from the kitchen and slit her wrist. fortunately the cut was not deep but her hand was full of blood.

when we reached her home her family was trying to help her but she was throwing her hands and legs making her body stiff so it was difficult to wrap cotton around her hand. somehow we managed to wrap cloth around her wrist. it's 2 am in the night everyone was sitting in the one side of the house watching her and chanting hanuman chalisa. she was in the middle. when i eye contacted her its like she was not there, she was totally different person not even blinking her eyes for a once messed up hairs, watery and wide open eyes like they show typical in bollywood horror movies. she was trying to eye contact with every one in room like she is not recognizing anyone. then she looked straight into her brother's eyes while licking her blood on her hand for a few seconds and her brother fainted. around 4 am she asked for food and she ate like 4x what she eats regularly and went to sleep after that.

all night her family was saying someone caught her like some '' buri shakti'' they were trying to take her to some baba. even her brother was convinced that it's some super natural power. but i kept saying that first let's take her to hospital but no one was understanding.

strange thing when she woke up in the morning she was totally normal and does not remember what happen last night. all she remember is she paid fair to rickshaw wala and one stranger (lady) asked her for direction and she came home and went to sleep cuz she was tired. we only asked her this in morning and never bring this topic when she is around. she has some expensive stuff with her like 2 phones, air pods and jewellery nothing was stolen. its been year for this scene since then no such episode occurs to her.

even today i think what kind of substance or psychotic behavior would have lead her to such actions. may be someone hypnotized her? may its drug? if its drug what kind of drug? i'm 99% sure it is some kind of drugs / meds but idk what.

need your views on this one.

p.s. - went to watch cricket match  just checked reddit so many comments from you guys thanks for all of your inputs. gonna read each and every comment and will make our next move with her brother. some comment are so accurate and acceptable that it gave new route to this incident what i have been thinking all year. sorry cant reply to every comment but would like to answer some common questions.

1 - any reason you didn’t call a doctor and get labs done?

a - it was already mid night regular doctor was not picking up our phone. and she was not in condition to take her to doctor on the other hand everyone was sacred to even go close to her it was something new for everyone and it was really shocking it took us whole next day to process what happened last night. didn't went to doctor cuz next day she was totally normal person and family don't wanted more trouble.

2 - what explanation did the family provide for the cut on the wrist the next morning?

a - when she woke up in morning we tried to explain her what happen last night. she refused to believe she think its impossible and she was in a sleep. for cut she say maybe she fell inside house somewhere and we are just making things up."

now, a builder has undertaken an ambitious 200-acre project to develop apartments and an it park in bellandur area. however, they face a unique challenge. despite investing their entire life's savings, hard work, and dedication, the encounter the most essential problem - ""there is entrance to the land bank"". the entire land bank lacks access from the outer ring road (orr), which could lead to the project's failure, financial ruin, and potential legal consequences. to address this, they've devised an unconventional solution: they plan to carve out a portion of the lake's southwest area to create an entrance road for the housing and it park units. this approach aims to provide high-paying employment to 80,000 software engineers in the ecoworld and housing for several thousand families. while the benefits to these families may outweigh the controversy, there is nothing in the law to permit such ideas. 

a stunning entrance now awaits you right next to devarbishnalli flyover, serving as the gateway to upscale residences and promising careers for the youth of bangalore and the entire nation.however, jury is till out on  whether it was a positive or negative move, but in my personal view, the law should not have been circumvented, and the government should have provided a legal and rational option for sustainable development, did the bbmp and revenue officials really permit this controversial situation to unfold? that's a story for another day.  

now, one might ask why does such a huge tech park have just two entrances creating traffic bottlenecks, that is also another story for another day. 

one of the city's most respected authorities on lakes, prof. tv ramachandara from indian institute of science, has conducted an in-depth study of the lake, and i'd like to share some of his insights below.

reddit,2023-10-28 11:56:31,"garbage burning in the open hey guys, looking for a serious solution to a garbage / plastic burning problem in my layout. the entire area is filled with white toxic smoke from burning plastic and other dry waste for hours every day and it's making us sick. 

i have tried all bbmp helpline numbers but no one even answers on the other end. i registered on the smart bengaluru app and they generated a grievance / complaint number and sent an sms with the number of a staff member assigned to the complaint but that number is not even active.

this is also related to waste collection by bbmp as they sometimes send the waste collection vehicle only once a week which is clearly not enough. i have noticed the vehicles assigned have the anjanapura ward numbers on them this is happening in narayana nagar, off kanakapura road.

this is a layout with a lot of kids and elderly and i can't believe people are resorting to burning garbage in 2023."
reddit,2023-10-28 17:45:50,"bellandur : when city planning meets corruption and incompetence this is the third story in a series of posts which try to uncover the reasons for problems in bellandur's infrastructure. for previous stories visit my profile. 

bellandur, a bustling locality in bengaluru, has been grappling with a severe lack of space and infrastructure. while it's easy to point fingers at city planners for their failure to design adequate road networks, the truth is far more complex. the city planners did lay down an extensive road plan, but corruption and incomeptance  within the system involving builders, landowners, and government officials from the bengaluru development authority (bda) and the bruhat bengaluru mahanagara palike (bbmp) has derailed the urban development of this area. in this blog post, we will delve into one specific instance of this ongoing struggle and how it relates to the city's master plan.

*rmp 2015: a blueprint for development*

in 2007, the bda unveiled the revised master plan (rmp) 2015, a roadmap for bengaluru's urban development. this master plan was intended to guide the city's growth, ensuring a balance between urbanization and the preservation of agricultural land. landowners were given the opportunity to develop their properties into large apartments or tech parks, provided they surrendered land for public roads as stipulated in the rmp-2015. this master plan is accessible to the public on bda and bbmp websites, and it outlines all proposed roads, offering a vision for the city's future.

the corruption conundrum : however, the reality on the ground tells a different story. many developers and landowners have proceeded with construction projects without fulfilling their obligation to allocate land for public roads. the reasons behind this failure are multi-faceted and include pervasive corruption, incompetance, political interference, and  confusion within the system. this chaotic situation is what bellandur finds itself in today.

*a case study: doddakannahalli*

let's consider a specific case in doddakannahalli. the bda officially published rmp-2015 in 2007 and mandated its adherence. in 2017, the bda issued a provisional document for rmp-2031, but this was not enforced. it created an updated plan, raising questions about which one should prevail. in this case, a landowner approached the bda for construction permits. according to rmp-2015, there was a road passing through their property. however, this road did not exist in rmp-2031. despite rmp-2015 being in force and rmp-2031 being provisional, the landowner was granted permission to construct because as per rmp-2031 there was no road. 

*the twist* : in 2021, the government withdrew rmp-2031. in 2022, the landowner completed construction and applied for an occupancy certificate. they were denied the certificate on the grounds that the building encroached on a road according to the master plan, and demolition was demanded.the landowner took the matter to court, arguing that government officials had approved the construction, and denying an occupancy certificate would result in significant financial loss. the blame was shifted to the government.

high *court's verdict* : the court, in both the writ petition and the writ appeal, sided with the landowner. their rationale was that since the government had initially granted approval, an occupancy certificate should be issued. this decision highlights a complex issue within the system, where government officials who are aware of the law and map details still approve projects that may later create problems.

the road's approval was nullified, as the building was granted an occupancy certificate. whether there was confusion regarding the application of rmp-2015 or rmp-2031 is irrelevant. ultimately, bellandur did not receive the planned road and it will not even in the future, and the area is now facing congestion. while people may point fingers at the planners, the real issue in india's urban planning lies with the plan's execution. the bellandur case exemplifies broader problems in urban planning and development, including corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of systemic coordination, leading to unplanned city expansion and insufficient infrastructure. the question remains as to why officials initially approved the building's construction only to later deny it. whether it was a strategic move, corruption, or incompetence remains uncertain.

reddit,2023-11-05 10:42:27,"unveiling the truth behind rmz ecoworld/adarsh's traffic woes and environmental clearances residents and office goers of rmz ecoworld /adarsh palm retreat have been a victim of traffic chaos for quite some time now. while the issue is not new, recent revelations surrounding the environmental clearance approvals for a new building behind honeywell building have raised questions about the truthfulness of certain claims made by the developer of the tech park. in this blog post, we will examine two specific lies that came to light during the approval process and discuss the potential consequences of these falsehoods for the community. this is a series of posts exposing the reasons for poor urban planning in the bellandur area.

**untruth 1: alleged tech park vehicle access**

one of the builder's claims that raised eyebrows during the environmental clearance process was the assertion that adarsh villas allow tech park vehicles to enter and exit from their private villa compound. while it is true that the roads in question are public roads encroached upon by the villa association as private roads, it has never been the case that non-villa vehicles were allowed to use them. this claim was seemingly made to show that traffic was already being distributed across multiple roads within the complex.

however, the reality is that this access has never been a reality, and residents have always maintained the exclusivity of these roads for villa owners. to resolve the traffic issue, the responsible authorities should consider enforcing the claimed access and ensure that it becomes a reality, thereby potentially alleviating the traffic problems in the area.

**untruth 2: the nonexistent road through saul kere**

another claim made by the builder to bolster their case for environmental clearances was the existence of a road through saul kere (lake). this, too, was a falsehood. there is no such road, and this lie further underscores the lack of transparency in the approval process. the builder's intent may have been to suggest that traffic would be distributed through a network of roads, but in reality, the entire tech park area has only two main roads, making the traffic issue even more pressing.

&amp;#x200b;

[the unfiltered untruths : screengrab of approval documents page 301. \(link below\)](https://preview.redd.it/in4hgnk9qgyb1.png?width=951&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee80c74a39706e3ca63ceec7d263bf62ba45bec9)

**the current state of affairs**

as of now, the new building project is already in progress, and it seems that there is no oversight or accountability in place to verify the accuracy of the claims made during the approval process. the community remains in the dark about the potential consequences of these falsehoods on their lives and the already problematic traffic situation.

**what' s the name of the authority that approved this traffic analysis ?**

in the central government, there exists a committee responsible for evaluating proposals and granting approval to various projects during board meetings. this committee operates under the jurisdiction of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, government of india.the committee extensively discussed and examined several aspects during their deliberations and documented these in the meeting minutes. topics covered included the vicinity of lakes, ecological considerations, b-kharab land usage, diversion of drainage channels, permits from the bangalore water supply and sewerage board (bwssb), and many others. however, it is noteworthy that the committee overlooked the crucial factor of analyzing the potential impact on human lives due to traffic-related factors.  **perhaps if they had accurately represented that only two roads connect to the tech park instead of falsely claiming the existence of four roads, questions about the matter might have arisen.** for detailed information on committee's decision, you can refer to page 149 of the meeting minutes, where the project received its approval. link is below.

&amp;#x200b;

**opportunity to make the situation better**

in the face of these revelations, it is essential to consider whether it is more prudent to help the builder by making lie 1 a reality, by forcing villa association to **allow non-villa vehicles to use the roads through adarsh villas**. this could potentially ease the traffic situation. may be this is the only opportunity for the public and the builder to make the situation better.  courts have always emphasized that roads with in a layout are not private. but its unsure how villa owners have been claiming that those private roads. however, it's equally important to hold the builder accountable for the untruths they told during the approval process. transparency and adherence to the facts are crucial in such large developments, as they impact the lives of countless residents and commuters. personally, i am not against development but i am all for well planned and sustainable development.

reddit,2023-11-07 13:36:12,"travel advisory for china i went to china on a work+leisure trip 2 weeks ago. i was there for 10 days and visited shanghai, beijing and xi'an. **i am making this travel advisory post** because there is often a lot of mystery around china and the restrictions enforced there, and since i had similar doubts and questions before i went on the trip, i tried searching for travel advisories on different subs, including this r/india but found no post that gives a straightforward and updated information, specifically in regards to people travelling to china from india. i even posted here asking about what to expect when travelling to china with an ‘ask india’ flair but got no reply.

so here are a few key points i will mention that are of main importance.

1. **covid guidelines** – there was no checking for that. neither was the covid vaccine certificate asked for, nor any rt-pcr test was done. there was not even any announcement in the flights or the airports regarding anything about covid. it came of as quite surprising. the airport i first landed on was shanghai international airport. however, do keep a printout of your vaccine certificate just in case. they take a biometric scan of all your fingers and a retina scan as well at the airport.
2. **health declaration** – just like many other countries, there is a health declaration form that they ask you to fill. it is done on the airport only, by scanning a qr code near the immigration checkpoint. the qr code opens up an online form on your phone browser which asks you basic details about if you are suffering from any kind of diseases, or have any flu symptoms or if you have any special medical condition. that form is straightforward and easy to fill with mostly, yes/no option.
3. **internet connectivity** – don’t use china’s local internet if you are travelling for a few days. it is advised that you get an international roaming pack activated on your mobile carrier. i have both airtel and jio, i got the international roaming activated on my airtel number and used only the mobile data on that, ***and every single app worked perfectly fine!*** be it facebook, whatsapp, instagram, google maps, gmail, paytm (for paying merchants back in india), even the cctv app that i have for my home worked perfectly fine on mobile data. i did number of isd calls back home in delhi, i did whatsapp video calling, audio calling without any problem. i communicated with friends and family on whatsapp, sent them pictures without any problem. i posted pictures on my facebook story almost every day. i could send/receive my personal and work emails easily. all this is possible only if you use the mobile data. if you try using the wi-fi at your hotel or buy a local sim of a chinese network provider then ***you will not be able to access any of these apps as they have been banned by the china government.*** you may be guided to use vpn applications like psiphon and others, so that you can circumvent the blockages by the chinese isps, but in my personal opinion you never know how safe such vpns can be with your sensitive data. also, the speed of internet access reduces considerably while using vpn. otherwise if you plan to use the hotel wi-fi then it is advised that you use microsoft outlook for mails and skype for communication. wechat is used commonly in china, but wechat is blocked on playstore or appstore, so if you still want to use wechat then download an ‘.apk’ file from the internet.
4. **payments** – there is a strict preference for cash only and small and medium level stores usually don’t accept visa, mastercard or rupay cards. only big multinational outlets or hotel accept cards. since no indian payment apps or upi works, the only option left is ‘wechat pay’ which is a commonly used payments app in china, just like our paytm or phonepe or upi. unfortunately this app is also not available on playstore or appstore so better to download its .apk file if you intend to use it. although shopkeepers have loose cash so cash transactions was not a problem.
5. **food** – the availability of vegetarian and jain food was okay. i visited shanghai, xi’an, and beijing and these three are top metro cities of china so there was no problem in finding vegetarian food. there are indian restaurants as well, which can be easily located, and they will serve you good indian food. most hotels do not have a facility for indian food in their in-house restaurants, so if you are travelling with an indian tour operator then it will be fine, otherwise you will have to visit local restaurants outside for vegetarian indian food. there is a wide variety for non-vegetarians.
6. **weather and environment** – the pollution level are somewhat similar to what we have here in india, and traffic condition is absolutely similar. if you have lived or been to delhi, mumbai or bangalore then you will feel at home when you will see the traffic. so take precaution on roads. keep your belonging safely in your pockets and avoid shady places as something as basic as being a victim of pickpocketing can ruin your trip.
7. **local travel** – there is the subway but for security reasons it is not advisable for tourists, so usually a taxi service is preferrable. they do not have uber there, they have a taxi service called ***didi***. it has english user interface as well for easy usage, but it is recommended to use wechat with it so that you can receive the message updates about your taxi. ***passport is a must while visiting any monumental place in china***. they scan the passports when you go to any monument, or museums, like if you visit the great wall of china or similar places. so do always carry it with you.
8. **conversation** – most of the chinese people don’t speak english and that can create a language problem. i used the ***google translator app*** throughout the journey and it worked like a charm. do make sure to download the chinese traditional and chinese simplified language packs before you go so that it can work even without the internet. voice typing requires internet and can mistype sometimes so use normal typing to avoid miscommunication. to read any printed material written in chinese language use the photo reading option in the google translate app.
9. **don’ts** – do not speak anything against the chinese government or the culture in a public place. even amongst each other in your group. if heard then you can be in trouble. i don’t know if it is because of a sense of hyper nationalism or something else, but they are very sensitive about their government and culture.

if there is any other update or contribution any one feels like adding then please do. thanks :)

greetings reddit community,

i'm reaching out today with a heavy heart and a plea for urgent legal advice regarding a distressing situation involving torrent power limited and its employees. the actions of manager abhishek shukla, executive engineer amarjeet kumar, and inderjeet have left me in a state of disbelief and desperation. despite filing multiple rtis and complaints to higher government officials, the influence of torrent power's higher management seems to have rendered my efforts futile. below, i provide more context and details of the situation.

background:

my family and i have become victims of the atrocities committed by torrent power employees, especially manager abhishek shukla and his associates. their actions have not only violated our rights but have also forced us into a state of helplessness due to their apparent impunity.

my complaint to higher management:

i had sent a complaint to their higher management previously, which outlined the troubling events and included a series of evidences. here's an excerpt from the complaint:

""*respected cxo,*

*evidences:-*

*raid of 01/08/2022*

*raid of 01/08/2022 part 2*

*raid of 01/08/2022 main video*

*raid of 30/07/2022 person in blue shirt is torrent power employee*

*raid video of 02/082022 is in attachments*

*please note that this complaint in no way should be treated as a request to against the penalty of unauthorized use of electricity as it is not even an offence in crpc and we have already paid the penalty rather the complaint is about the extortion by the corrupt manager named mr. abhishek shukla and his conduct who is posted in torrent power vigilance unit, agra as it is clear from the attached cctv footage that on his order raids were conducted on a private premises without the permission of the owner. the links above are footages of the raids conducted on five different days each time with a new team. this is clear cut case of harassment of general public and extortion by the manager mr. abhishek shukla and his subordinates amar and inder as these three are the ones who asked for bribe openly and forcefully broke into a private premises as can be seem in the video attached of 02/08/2022. the call history of amar repeatedly asking for bribes on behalf of all the three is also attached.*

*note everyone mentioned above is a torrent power vigilance employee in agra.*

*this is to inform you that a torrent power team was inspecting for katiyas and unauthorised use of electricity in nagla rambal on 04/08/2022 on 12:40 pm. they even broke into our property to see if we were stealing electricity which is against the law without a warrant as can be seen in the attached video.*

*moreover, it is informed that the torrent power manager in vigilance mr. abhishek shukla likes to use the d in ldmf formula as 365 days to harass the customer when the real age of the structure in question is in actual 1 month, it is to be noted that independent witnesses will testify the same moreover breaking into a property and harassing a customer are against the law as per uttar pradesh electricity regulatory commission order passed in 2009 whose copy is attached and strict action is to be taken against officers which do not comply to the same.*

*the manager mr. abhishek shukla is morally corrupt to occupy the post and an internal investigation and first information report should be launched and filed against him as he is running a literal extortion racket in this area if i don't get justice and the manager continues with the firm then i would have no option but appeal to the world media for justice and send the evidences to them.*

*moreover it is informed that i had shown a notarized agreement which shows that the structure in question was occupied two days before but the corrupt manager mr. abhishek shukla did not pay any heed to it and forced me to pay penalty for a much longer period stating that my connection is going to be disconnected if i don't pay up which was his was of asking for a bribe without doing the formalities of sending of notice so that he could pocket the amount without a trace of it.*

*we are literally being harassed by the torrent power team lead by amarjit and some inderjit or their names could be amar and inder.*

*the video for their harassment are attached as breaking into a private premises without permission is without dispute a case of harassment.*

*request you to take stringent action against the full team.*

*the independent witnesses which would testify for their harassment and asking for bribes are:-*

*1.vishal yadav*

*2. manju yadav*

*3. subodh kumar yadav*

*4. rajesh kumar*

*5. son of pavan*

*it is to be noted had we paid them the bribes they would have not falsely implicated us, i was at torrent agra vigilance office yesterday and day before yesterday and met numerous people who were also falsely implicated by mr. abhishek shukla and his team whose story, i will also present to the world.*

*please reply to this mail if you want their sworn testimony of the team asking for bribes.*

*also you are informed that the previous teams had also come inside our premises and literally raided it without our permission.*

*torrent agra has become a bribe collection agency at this point.*

*please find the video as evidence attached also attached is the screenshot of call history of a torrent power worker named amar asking for rs. 60,000 as bribe on the behalf of mr. abhishek shukla(please note that in starting there are only incoming calls and no outgoing call was picked). what is to be noted is that the person seen in the final few seconds of the video is the person amar asking for bribes on phone on behalf of his manager.*

*the contact number of that torrent power worker named amar is:- xxxxxxxxxx as can be seen in the screenshot.*

*thank you*

*regards,my signature*""

issues at hand:

unauthorized raids: torrent power employees, directed by manager abhishek shukla, conducted unauthorized raids on private properties without any consent from the property owners. this blatant violation of privacy and misuse of power is deeply concerning.

extortion and corruption: abhishek shukla and his subordinates, especially amarjeet kumar, have openly demanded bribes and extorted money from us. they even broke into our property without a warrant and coerced us into paying unjustified penalties and bribes.

abuse of power: abhishek shukla appears to manipulate calculations and regulations to his advantage, causing undue harassment and unjust penalties. his actions breach the regulations set by the uttar pradesh electricity regulatory commission.

seeking your advice:

despite my best efforts to address these issues, the apparent influence of torrent power's higher management has thwarted any meaningful resolution. i am in desperate need of legal advice and guidance on how to proceed in this seemingly dire situation. i am specifically seeking advice on:

legal recourse: what legal options are available to hold individuals like manager abhishek shukla and his associates accountable for their actions, especially when higher management seems to protect them?

raising awareness: should i consider involving media or public awareness campaigns to bring this issue to light and put pressure on torrent power to address these allegations?

whistleblower protection: how can i ensure the safety of my family and myself while pursuing justice in the face of these challenges?

final thoughts:

the conduct of manager abhishek shukla and his team has not only shaken my faith in the system but has also caused immense distress for my family. if anyone in the reddit community has experience dealing with similar situations, or if you possess legal expertise, your insights and advice would mean the world to me.

i want to stress that this is an urgent matter, and your help could potentially be a lifeline in this situation. thank you for taking the time to read my post, and i look forward to any guidance or advice you can provide.

&amp;#x200b;

getting there

pretty smooth roads leading to the venue till you reach the final 2-3 kilometers. you go through small lanes in the end. finally, you are forced to leave your vehicle and walk a kilometer or more depending on your assigned gate.

&amp;#x200b;

entering

no crowd control. everyone getting pushed around. indians really do have no sense of personal space. no one wants to leave even a few inches of space between them and yourself. even though our seats are already designated and we all know when the game begins. it was no different than any pedestrian gathering where everyone's loud, pushy and on edge.

&amp;#x200b;

when i finally arrived at 'gate 2'. first, some cops half-ass frisked us to see if we have any unusual items.

they confiscated and just straight up dumped all bottles of water and those air horns. the last 20 feet, we were walking on air horns and discarded water and cold drink bottles. no dust bin in sight. it was disgusting. the cops were themselves covered in water and juice stains. one cop had what looked like kheer on his pants and was agitated. he didn't even frisk so many people cause he was so pissed off with the spillage on his clothes. is this how a cop's life should be?

&amp;#x200b;

next, we were frisked by more cops. this time, they needed us to empty our pockets and show them everything we're carrying. very few things are allowed in the stadium.

&amp;#x200b;

after this, you're in the arena and it's nice and airy. you're still not inside the 'bowl' yet from where you can see the pitch. this is the space between the stadium seats and the 'outside world'. just a vast expanse of land. there's tons of space in this area thankfully so you can just walk around click pictures etc.

addition:
exiting the stadium is another ordeal. no one to tell you where to go so you just follow the sea of people. no network to use google map to orient yourself. no signages. zero effort from management to direct you. they are only interested in talking you where not to go but not to tell you where to go.

outside, you are left to yourself. imagine 60000 people with no transportation. it's late so buses and metros are shut. no cabs available in ahmedabad in that area. only greedy rickshaw walas. they were asking 500 bucks per seat! so if 3 friends go, that's 1500 bucks to sit in the rickshaw.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

seating

seats are easy to find based on the details on tickets. but getting to your seat is another matter. right before you can get to your seat, they check your tickets again to ensure you are not entering a different 'block' than the one on your ticket. to do this, there's a barricade. so imagine dozens of fans squeezing through a tiny space. very annoying and not well-designed. next.... you start walking down to your seat. there are multiple steps as you can imagine. they're all just grey in colour and no lining or colouration. so you need to watch your step carefully to avoid tripping.

&amp;#x200b;

the aisle between two clusters of seats is not very wide. just a little wider than an airplane aisle maybe? so annoying. i mean come on!

&amp;#x200b;

seats were clean and seemed new and sturdy. comfortable too. they don't recline but the plastic backrest bends quite a bit. so in a sense they do recline.

there's decent leg room. alphabets and numbering on seats and rows is easily visible.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

washrooms

to their credit, they made quite a few washroom stalls for both men and women. but still not enough..... the stadium seats 1 lakh+ people. there are some drink breaks and a half time. people tend to all flock together during these times so you can imagine the crowd. during half time, there was a slow moving stream of men walking into the washroom and a simultaneous slow moving stream of men with wet hands and wet faces and wet hair walking out of the washroom from the same entrance. all touching and shoving at each other. the floor was completely wet and brown by this point. 

the washrooms were clean and spacious for a smaller crowd. just that this stadium hosts 1 lakh+ people.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

food and drinks

expensive as expected. some items were relatively vfm. others were obscenely expensive. but what's annoying is the size of the 'shops'. each food or drink 'shop' or 'stall' was no more wider than 8 feet across.

think about this. so if you want domino's pizza, you go to the domino's shop/stall and are competing for standing space with 1000 others who want domino's pizza from an 8-feet wide shop front. genious.

&amp;#x200b;

yes, there were more than 1 domino's 'shops'. but there were 1000 more fans at the other shop too :)

what an absolute mess during the crowded hours to try and get food. it felt like a refugee camp. people stepping over each other's feet, holding out currency notes, hoping they get serviced first.

&amp;#x200b;

the drinks shops were all wet and mucky because invariably, people buy drinks and spill them immediately cause some other dude is 3 inches away and shoves at you. disgusting.

&amp;#x200b;

there were guys who were bringing the drinks to the seats as well but that's annoying in it's own way too. dozens of open glasses of pepsi in a tray that have been coughed at by god knows how many fans before they made their way to your seat.

&amp;#x200b;

just let people have the bottles. with lids. but no..... indian fans don't deserve bottles because indian fans throw bottles at players. we fcked it up for ourselves.

&amp;#x200b;

water was another nightmare. no packaged drinking water allowed into the venue. they snatch those away.

so if you are thirsty, you have to get up from your seat, go to a water counter where you basically self-serve water into styrofoam cups from a tiny tap attached to an unbranded 20-litre cannister. the cup itself has a capacity of 300 ml or less. the water area was again, very very dirty and wet because obvious spillage.

&amp;#x200b;

if your friend or aged parent wants water, you carry this open styrofoam cup thing inside (while more people cough around it). it's not a short walk. it is the world's largest stadium after all. and if you think you'll carry extra water so that there's 'spare water' for your next thirst, where do you keep these cups at your seat? hold them in your hands with no lids? that's exactly what people had to do.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

visibility

amazing visibility from the middle rows. not too close from the pitch (otherwise you will see a giant fence in front of you because indians are rowdy) and not too far from the pitch (otherwise you can't see much of anything at all because it's such a large stadium).

&amp;#x200b;

now the frustrating bit:

between two 'blocks', (block a, b, c, d etc etc), there is a wall with a tall fence, so that our indian monkey friends don't illegally jump from one block to another. (imagine paying for a cheaper block and then jumping over to a more expensive block). to avoid all this, the tall fences. but there are seats right next to the fence!..... so basically all seats next to the fence get to see only half the ground. the remaining half can be seen through the fence. imagine going all the way to a stadium to watch a game of cricket through a fine fence. 

&amp;#x200b;

the score can only be seen on 2 giant screens in the stadium. but some squinting required. replays are rare. most of the time, you lose the moment forever (unless you go home and rewatch).

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

atmosphere

absolutely amazing. the cheer of 1 lakh+ people cannot be described in words. it can only be experienced in a handful of sporting arenas around the world. the 'pole-less' lighting in the stadium is a sight to behold. there are no 4 giant poles of light here. but instead, a tiara-like array of lights. it's gorgeous. there are also lasers that are really powerful and spectacular. then there are dozens of these 'hovering' orbs. spherical lights that seem to bob up and down in the air, glowing various shades as they do. very very cool. the whole stadium is massive. the roof, the pillars, the stairs etc. it's all very grand!

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

my takeaway

they should really have thought the whole thing through and done an even better job of providing for the thousands of people who come there. india has this illness of building great castles in a pile of dirt. that's what the whole experience felt like. such a big event and so few supporting infrastructure and services. in a way, it is typically 'indian' as an experience. grandeur with corner cutting sprinkled here and there."

reddit,2023-11-24 17:53:51,"how speed and scale can help india fight pollution 
hi everyone,

i recently came across a website called [speed and scale], which is a tracker for the global progress on climate action. it shows how different countries and regions are performing on 10 action plans that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. the 10 action plans are:

- electrify transportation
- decarbonize the grid
- fix food
- protect nature
- clean up industry
- remove carbon
- win politics and policy
- turn movements into action
- innovate!
- invest!

each action plan has a scorecard that shows the current status, the target for 2030, and the gap to close. the scorecard also shows the key drivers, barriers, and solutions for each action plan. you can explore the website to learn more about the details and the data sources.

i think this website is very useful and informative, especially for us in india, where pollution is a major problem that affects our health and environment. according to the [bbc], india has 22 of the world's most polluted 30 cities, and air pollution causes more than a million deaths every year. pollution is also linked to other issues such as water scarcity, soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change.

so how can we use speed and scale to help us tackle pollution in india? here are some ideas:

- we can use the website to track our progress on the 10 action plans and compare it with other countries and regions. this can help us identify our strengths and weaknesses, and learn from the best practices and innovations of others.
- we can use the website to raise awareness and educate ourselves and others about the urgency and the benefits of climate action. we can share the website with our friends, family, colleagues, and social media networks, and start a conversation about how we can contribute to the 10 action plans in our daily lives and choices.
- we can use the website to advocate and demand for more ambitious and effective climate policies and actions from our government and other stakeholders. we can use the data and the solutions from the website to support our arguments and proposals, and to hold our leaders accountable for their commitments and performance.

i believe that by following the 10 action plans, we can not only reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming, but also improve our pollution situation and enhance our quality of life. speed and scale is a valuable tool that can help us achieve this goal. i hope you will check it out and join me in this journey.

thank you for reading. please share your thoughts and feedback in the comments."

**march 15**: i buy edureka forbes filter. 

**december 1**: my aqua-guard stops working.  i try and examine if it is some problem that i can fix myself. turns out, i can't. the technical problems are still under warranty so i am not really worried. 

**december 3**: i download the edureka forbes app to register complaint. the reviews are all about how no professional is ever assigned to look into the complaints. any how, i register complaint.  

**december 3- december 7**: no professional is assigned for repair. meanwhile, i have to buy endless bisleri bottles just so i could have drinking water at my disposal. 

**december 7:** professional is assigned but the professional refuses to visit me in my off-hours. agrees for a date on saturday. 

**december 9**: professional visits me. tells me that he was not conveyed by edureka forbes that the aqua-guard is actually not working (why else would a customer even lodge a complaint otherwise?), so he does not have the tool to repair the aqua-guard. he video calls someone and shows him the faulty aqua guard. the person on the other end says that the fault lies in the circuit. the circuit is to be changed. 

the technician tells me that it will be another three days before the relevant part is parceled. and i live in mumbai for fucks sake, the company is located in mumbai, less than 30 minutes from where i live. where do you even have to parcel the part from?

meanwhile, he has made a makeshift arrangement for me to have my drinking water, the circuit is bypassed so when i turn on the wall tap the aqua guard is connected to, water comes out via the filter's tap, and i don't really have the technical competence to understand if any filtering is being done at all because the aqua guard is switched off. 

for a company that sells something as critical as a water filter, this is just god-awful service."

reddit,2023-12-14 11:44:51,"rethinking india's stance on dual citizenship: a loss of identity and opportunity dear r/india,

i recently came across this article on the [goans for goa](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/goans-portuguese-nationality-problem-renewing-their-indian-passport-9067528/) movement, and that has made me ponder over india's stance on dual or multiple citizenships and the implications it has on our global diaspora. the recent legal changes (vide a circular issued in 2022 by the ministry of home affairs) and instances of citizenship revocation have brought to light a broader issue: the rigid policies that force a choice between *karmabhoomi* (land of action) and *janmabhoomi* (land of birth).

## the heart of the matter:

india's policy of not allowing dual citizenship is not just a legal issue; it's a matter of identity and belonging. for many of us with deep-rooted connections to india, being forced to choose between our homeland and our place of residence feels unfair. it's a choice no one should have to make.

## the case of oci revocation:

take, for example, the cases where overseas citizenship of india (oci) cards have been revoked for criticizing the government (see [ashok swain case](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-hc-seeks-centres-stand-on-ashok-swains-plea-against-cancellation-of-oci-card/article67295137.ece)). this isn't just about a travel document; it's about silencing voices and cutting ties with the motherland. it's a form of bullying that undermines the very principles of democracy and free speech.

## democracy and individual rights:

india prides itself on being the world's largest democracy. a democracy should protect individual rights, including the right to maintain a relationship with one's motherland. the current policy seems to overlook this fundamental aspect, treating those who live abroad as less entitled to their indian identity.

## the loss for india:

this rigid policy is not just a loss for individuals; it's a loss for india too. the global indian community contributes significantly to the world in various fields. by forcing a choice, we risk alienating a valuable part of our culture and heritage.

## the need for a national conversation:

it's time we reevaluate our stance on dual citizenship. this is not about pointing fingers at any particular government or administration; it's about recognizing that this policy, in its current form, is outdated. we need a national conversation around this, one that respects the complexities of identity and the realities of a globalized world.

## conclusion:

why should it be a choice between *karmabhoomi* and *janmabhoomi*? what right do the powers in new delhi have to dictate the nature of our relationship with our motherland? i urge you all to think about this and share your thoughts. it's time for a change, and it starts with us."
reddit,2023-12-17 11:09:13,"please help me find a simple power backup solution for my onu + router. ups won't work due to low load cutoff, mini ups won't work because two devices. hi,

here's the situation - i want a backup solution that lets my onu and router run during power cuts. power cuts here don't last very long, so if it can just manage 30 mins, that will be fine. onu is 12v 0.5a and router is 12v 1a so total is not even 20w. just for reference, both of these have power cables that are integrated with the adapter/plug - the cords are not removable, if they were, i could plug it into some 12v battery or something somehow.

problem: most upss on the market have a poorly documented low load cutoff. it is rarely mentioned what the cut off exactly is, but it's definitely well above 20w, it's usually around 50w or something. so it shuts off if the only thing it's powering are those small things.

there are mini upses on the market meant specifically for routers. those have only one dc output - for the router. so my onu won't run which makes it pointless.

potential solutions i can think of:

1) buy two mini upses. seems an awful waste.

2) buy a ups without a low load cutoff. can't seem to find any that definitely don't have this.

3) artifically add some load to a ups to get past the low load cutoff. can't think of any elegant/cheap way to do so. 

any help would be greatly appreciated. thank you!"

reddit,2023-12-24 12:30:06,"[rant] has anyone else noticed the rise of useless flyovers? so, there's this railway crossing near my home and very frequently (4-5 times a day) people have to wait for the train to pass before they can cross the railway tracks, so the geniuses of my city decided to create a flyover. 

as a result of the construction, power cuts became much more frequent, water pipes burst more frequently and we had to pay for water to be brought to our place via tractors (for months), the road below the flyover became a mud road (a mud road you can't real cross during rainy season) and it completely destroyed the mom and pop stores which were dependent on that road and many big businesses (banks, hotels &amp; other commercial establishments) went out of business too as most of roads below were blocked and the ones who weren't blocked were so bad it was hard to traverse them with a bike (cars can't move even now) and after all this we got this underwhelming flyover which joins nowhere to nowhere else. i have had lots of sleepless nights trying to understand why the flyover was constructed. also, since the water pipes burst very often, we had to deal with sewage/silt getting into the water supply (through which we also get our drinking water). i remember showering with water which is brown because the pipes burst. 

now,   
1. i feel like an underpass would have done a splendid job at solving the problem

2. most of the vehicles (busses, cars/bikes) who were passing the railway crossing were traveling to the main bus stand, the flyover doesn't even join the bus stand and the point before we cross the railway crossing, thus it has made the journey longer for the people who were traveling to the bus stand. plus now you have to cross the flyover and take a turn back to get to the bus stand increasing the inefficiency of the whole ordeal. 

3. my friend told me that most of these flyovers were constructed during the covid pandemic in a desperate bid by the government to increase jobs and spending. good idea, but, why could you not build something else? like, idk, roads? to be completely honest, they were building some roads and my college got some new buildings, but still, i don't understand the point of worsening the problem. 

4. the bloody flyover hasn't solved the problem since most the people would prefer to take the shorter route below than use the flyover. 

5. this area was a major commercial space and the flyover completely destroyed it. private companies closed but the government banks and other establishments could not close and are thus running an unprofitable operation.   


so, in my humble estimation, they spend crores of rupees to build something that destroyed many people's lives by eating their jobs, destroyed some houses, transformed a vibrant neighborhood into a shabby slum like area, caused uncountable inconveniences to the students and people who still use the road below as many schools and businesses are still operating here (trust me, you can't walk here in the rainy season) and after all that we got a flyover which only benefits a small percentage of people, but the same thing could have been achieved by building an underpass and repairing the roads.   
i.e., the government spent good amount of money to make people's lives much worse. we are so fixated on buildings new infra that we don't even think if the infra is needed at a place or not! ughh...."

reddit,2023-12-29 23:04:32,"bengaluru has grown beyond its geographical and sustainable limits. karnataka's other cities have missed the development bus completely in the north, bengaluru has almost touched with nelamnagala and dabaspete. chikkaballapur is not far. devanahalli is now part of bengaluru. down south, bengaluru has transcended bidadi so much so that atleast 30 kms of mysore road is still within the city. on the other side, ecity has touched hosur in tn and kr puram has eaten into omr raring to go near hoskote.



both on a geographical and a sustainable scale, bengaluru has been squeezed. such unchecked growth coupled with haphazard development is a recipe for real estate exploitation, improper infrastructure and eventually the lowering of the brand bengaluru. in its penchant to make the bengaluru the hub, successive governments across all parties have ignored other good cities.



mysore/mandya : this gets little bit of development pie only because of the jds connection and political bigwigs from this region. but the pie is too less compared to what bengaluru has. credit to the politicians from this region for throwing weight for the regions they come from.



belgaum (not to be confused with belgium 😅) : beyond the grand posturing of construction a winter holiday resort for mlas (read suvarna soudha), the so called/so dubbed 'second capital' of karnataka is completely ignored. this city got its first indian constructed railway flyover after 75 years!! so much for the second capital!! it has one of the biggest foundry clusters in india but our state government ignores it. 



hubli/dharwad :  this city perhaps has the best potential of being a economy compatriot in the northern karnataka but unfortunately it has been ignored as well. just read the number of politicians from this region going onto become chief ministers, and union ministers but the politiccians have essentially used the people of this twin cities as a platform and then completely ignored them!!! brts and a failed techpark is all the development happening. telco, marco polo and other ssi have been ignored. the hubli-dharward-belagavi are also nearer to ports than bangalore and are nearer to mumbai as well. however such straetgic location has not been exploited. 



mangalore : the first thing that comes to mind when i hear mangalore is tourism and nit surathkal! nothing more than that. nothing pains when you see a port city in the important west coast of india being ignored. look at how gujarat capitalized on the port city of surat and they don't even have sea directly just tapi river



gulbarga/bellary : with thermal plants and a gateway to the steel and manuf hubs in central india, gbl (kalburgi) and bellary had it all going. but except the reddy brothers and blistering heat, i see no real development in these regions compared to bengaluru. 



karnataka cannot just piggyback on the bengaluru bubble and boast development. karnataka has the highest population density deficit between capital city and other cities. for all the people in this sub from others parts of india coming here, perhaps you are unaware, all youths from all parts of karnataka just run towards bengaluru because there are very few and non-existent employment opportunities in their own cities/towns. more than half of my friends/contacts hailing from other cities in karnataka are in bengaluru. this is only adding to the problem rather than fuel development.



if any of you guys here new to bengaluru/karnataka, do travel beyond the bengaluru-mysore belt.. you will notice such stark difference in terms of infrastructure and development. the slogan of karnataka tourism is one state - many worlds. its rather true because it's one state - two contrasting worlds. one of bengaluru and the other of rest of karnataka.


it is time to look beyond bengaluru. 
in the 2000s we used to see this quote plastered all over by the infamous arindam chaudhuri - ""dare to think beyond the iims"". i hope the state government dares to see beying the bengalurus.



p.s : it took me 55 minutes to reach whitefield to marathahalli last week. i could circumvent the complete  city of second capital of karnataka in the same time - twice!"

reddit,2024-01-01 17:10:23,"people who have studied/taught kids abroad: what things need to be eliminated? and what kind of knowledge / books must be inculcated into our children's syllabi to increase their advantage in the outside world? there are huge loads of syllabi and most of them are overburdened with too many pages for rote which will sadly be of little use. 

for eg - 

children can rely on documentaries to understand history/geography.
one documented video from a well-learned person can benefit thousands in a short time.

the dictations should work only in language classes but not in science/economics/history classes where they simply copy from the textbooks. it simply means poor quality of education and 0 input from teachers.

examinations shouldn't be penalized on memory only. people need more skill than rote memory to excel.

many of the syllabi can be unburdened and many chapters can be compressed to reduce the information density.

recitations of poems: i understand memorizing lines for the drama, but the recitation of poems? its time taking and hardly does enhance any skill in a child. rather than that, viva can be introduced to ask which lines mean what.

additional :

introductory things can benefit our population a lot :

for example, if there is some problem in the road in your area ., how to fix it?

the school teacher sees irregularities in pwd contractor's work, rather than shouting on twitter, how does he report?
 
i guarantee you, half the guys reading here won't know which &amp; how to approach local bodies to get it fixed, its not our fault, we are trained to suck it up and not ask questions above. i.e, its been so since colonial times

in us &amp; uk you won't need the above, but a red tape country like india needs it. the system is built so to hide information from the public

information about banking, investments, and insurance: we have been relying on fd &amp; rd, and ever since that 92 scam ppl vastly avoid stocks for understandable reasons. the large population didn't know about banks &amp; thought it to be rich ppl thing even during the 90s. people are still taking loans from shady financial services
a financially educated population will vastly benefit


necessary - proper driving lesson - people wont care until it shows up in grades, right?

bright side - i don't have issues how math is taught, but 11 , 12 is a steep curve though

this is just not criticism, we can inculcate tech in our education to advantage, their are pros and cons to it. just wanted to know your side."

reddit,2024-01-05 15:24:07,"problem with surya nissan, whitefield. hello everyone, 
i and my family have been facing a problem since few months. we are a middle class family, my father is an “ ex service man “. 
our family decided on buying a car, it’s our first car and we decided to go through csd ( canteen facility for army people ), which would see us spending around 1 lakh less than on road price. 
we decided to go with nissan magnite, after discussions and a payment of 3 lakhs to the showroom. 
we didn’t receive the car, it’s been 4 months. 
when we enquired with army canteen depot, they said they never received any request for nissan from the showroom. 
the showroom responded that they made a mistake and sent money to them by wrong name and address. 

it’s been 4 months, they’re not responding to us. not even ready to have a conversation, we dont know what to do or which direction to go from here. 
the showroom is surya nissan, whitefield. 
any suggestions on what to do from here, anything would help.

thank you"

reddit,2024-01-06 16:09:15,"a case for euthanising stray dogs perhaps fostered by our dog-loving colonials, india and its people have held dogs dear to them for centuries. yet, as i write this piece, hundreds in the country continue to die from rabies transmitted through stray dog bites, and thousands more through road accidents caused directly or indirectly by stray dogs. at the heart of the matter, i propose that stray dogs be euthanised, or at the very least neutered, to tackle the root problem. broadly, there are two arguments – one from a moral/philosophical perspective, and another a more practical one. 

touching upon the former first - i love my dogs and cats as much as the next person, but mental clarity requires us to separate emotions from logic. dogs are not nefarious beings that humans owe protection against. i agree wholeheartedly that most dogs are friendly – perhaps even servile towards us. it is not that humans have wished for such a rapid increase in the stray dog population. it is not our kindness but arguably our cavalier attitude towards waste generation and management that has led to the multiplicity of the canines. dogs suffer from disease, hunger, disability, and abuse. dogs are undeserving of this quality of life, and those justifying their presence are palpably the ones most responsible for it.

from a more practical perspective, dogs do not also serve a role in the ecosystem. developed countries have far lesser number of stray dogs and have a perfectly balanced environment. if birds, fish, frogs, insects, snakes, and every other animal imaginable can be termed ‘pests’, what stops us from giving dogs the same monicker? we are blinded by emotions. 
the numbers speak for themselves. a total of 307 people died from rabies just last year (see source 1) and stray dogs account for as much as 69% of all road accidents in india (see source 2). if our conscience does not allow us to put down dogs, does it allow us to chalk up such a large number of deaths and grievances caused to thousands of families, only to please ourselves under the pretense of being ‘kind’? 

my proposal is simply a modification of what is already being done - all pet dogs be registered with a local municipal authority. except, a semantic widening of ‘pet dogs’ should be undertaken to include those that citizens consider their foster pets. the rationale is to have registered citizens take responsibility for the dogs, including having them vaccinated in a timely fashion, ensuring that they are not ill-treated, and having them reasonably trained to avoid mishaps. all unregistered dogs that are not registered should be gathered and humanely euthanized.

i do not expect the above to be swiftly enacted into law, but if it has managed to at least convince a few fellow citizens to understand the depth of the problem, i rest gratefully. 

thanks,

a concerned citizen

reddit,2024-01-07 21:46:23,"why justice system in india is failing to deliver proper justice for rape victims. seeing lot of rape case news, i just searched for popular rapes cases in india to know, what happened after case is filed and like how courts are delivering justice in such cases and i found multiple disgusting cases like 
1) in 1992, rajasthan, ajmer rape case, where more than 250 school girls were groomed and took their nude photos and raped them and blackmailed them with that photos, to not tell this to anyone. the accused are a group of muslim men led by farooq and nafis chisty, who are are part of khadim family that oversaw the care taking of popular ajmer sharif dargah, which is visited by many actors and business men in country. in this case, the main accused members are roaming happily outside where as, victims are blackmailed by both accused and even some media about publishing the compromising pictures that they got from accused and extorted money, how disgusting was that. even, accused are part of congress party at that time and also threatened openly for communal riots in ajmer if touched so, there was also three day bandh imposed and even congress in center backed these filthy dogs. surprisingly, the case happened when the bjp was in power in state and congress in center but still no proper justice was provided. 
2) we all heard about 2020 hathras case, where a dalit women was gang raped and also the police acted as goons by cremating the victim's body in mid night without the family member's permission. and only main accused sandeep was given life imprisonment and no clarity on other 3 accused members: ramu, lavkush and ravi. sandeep said that, he was in relationship with the victim and the family members of victim did not liked it and so killed her and framed him in this case but if it is true, why bjp government and police need to rush the cremation. how can that be proved and where is transparency here. why justice system is so lazy. here, in this case, the bjp government shamelessly sided with accused which lead to this confusion and choas in this case. the victim is completely disrespected here.
3) and suzette jordan case(park street case) in 2012,  in kolkata where jordan was offered lift to her home at night from night club by 5 people and then, all the 5 gangraped her in the car and dumped her on road and later she came out bravely and said, "" why should i hide my identity when it was not even my fault? why should i be ashamed of something that i did not give rise to? i was subjected to brutality and i was subjected to rape and, i am fighting and i will fight"" . 3 of the accused in this case where arrested in 2012 and they are: nasir khan, ruman khan and sumit bajaj and also all 5 of them were found and proved guilty by court in 2015 and given 10 years imprisonment but only 3 were arrested and other 2 were not arrested yet but in 2016, the other 2 accused, who are prime accused: kader khan and mohommad ali were also arrested. but here, the important point in this case is that, tmc party leader and cm mamatha benerjee called the victim suzette jordan a liar and accused her of trying to embarrass the government even before the investigation started but later, in investigation, it is proved that, they raped the victim. so, this is how rape victims who come out are bashed and disrespected even before investigation. how cruel is this?


---- there are many more cases like this. why justice system can not be more transparent and productive? i know, there are some cases for example, nirbhaya case where justice is served but only after huge push from public accross the country and there are fake police encounters like in hyderabad disha case, which also indicates bad state of justice and police system with too much of involvement of politics. i am in postion to decide punishment for accused but atleast minimum transparency and effective functioning is expected from judiciary. i understand, there may be some practical problems like fake cases, huge population and less staff etc for this sad state of affairs but still it shall not be reason for this kind of disgusting mess in the country. the accused who can politically and financially influence are getting away without much of punishment, and also some are getting away in the name of communal tensions and politicians are siding with them to preserve their vote bank that is pure boot licking. i can not even imagine the feelings of family member's of victims who are fighting for justice in this system.

- and there is always lot of sound when some rape happens and it slowly comes down with time and justice system takes decades and decades for court trails. i understand, it is because of new cases happening regularly but just felt so emotional, so posted this to know your opinions on this and how you feel about victim especially. 

sorry for my bad grammer."

reddit,2024-01-08 21:58:57,"the bollywood film ‘mohabbatein’ (2000) is a groundbreaking sex-ed film about male masturbation spoilers ahead.

&amp;#x200b;

bollywood’s roster of adult films is a barren wasteland, dotted by the occasional tusshar kapoor/milap zaveri release. yet, there may be hope for the genre as long as trailblazing production house *yrf* keeps churning out experimental masterpieces. for well before there were *kyaa kool hain hum*, *masti*, and *ragini mms*, there was *mohabbatein*. as on several other occasions, *yrf* embraced the role of innovator and at the turn of the millennium brought to bollywood what is till date the industry’s only sex-ed film. unlike bollywood’s other attempts at adult cinema, *mohabbatein* seeks to educate—not titillate—as moustachioed maestro aditya chopra examines attitudes towards male masturbation, specially amongst adolescents. to avoid offending conservative sensibilities, this sociological examination is cleverly hidden within a family-friendly romantic drama tale and presented in allegorical terms.

*mohabbatein* features an ensemble cast, led by amitabh bachchan and *ddlj* background actor shah rukh khan, with aishwarya rai as a guest star. although the cast also includes celebrated thespians uday chopra, jugal hansraj, and shamita shetty, a complete listing is omitted here for the sake of brevity. bachchan plays narayan shankar, headmaster of the prestigious gurukul boys’ college. shankar is a stickler for rules, and imposes upon his students the need for tradition, prestige, and discipline. his rules extend to a blanket ban on romantic relationships, which forms the crux of the film’s conflict. srk plays raj aryan, a music teacher and disgraced gurukul alumnus who has returned to the institute under anonymity, with the single goal of melting shankar’s icy heart and impressing upon him the power of love. finally, aishwarya rai plays the deceased megha, shankar’s late daughter and the love interest of raj aryan.

in a figurative sense, gurukul—with its forced confinement, all-male student body, and rigid rules—is a portrayal of restrictive societies that enforce adolescent sexual repression through gender segregation and harsh oversight. narayan shankar, as headmaster, is the enforcer of said oversight and abides by his oppressive regulations to set an example. gurukul’s official motto—‘parampara prathishta anushasan’—may be shortened to ‘pp anushasan’, the word ‘pp’ being slang for a man’s meat pole of love and ‘anushasan’ meaning discipline or regulation. thus through its motto, the institution reveals its intention to exercise total control over its students’ genitalia.

metaphorically, narayan shankar’s rejection of all things romantic/sexual, and his stubborn opposition to any form of change—stated by him multiple times throughout the film—is an allusion to his opposition to puberty and the sexual changes it brings along with it. his choice of garments throughout the film—dull black trousers coupled with matching black sherwanis—prevents viewers from getting a view of his lush curves and adds to his thoroughly sexless demeanour. additionally, shankar takes pride in his habit of staring right at the sun for several minutes every morning, which is a clever allusion to the popular myth about masturbation causing damage to eyesight—a lifetime of total abstinence from masturbation has prevented shankar’s eyes from taking any damage, and therefore he can stare full-bore into the sun for as long as he pleases. given all this, it is unknown how he fathered a daughter in his state of permanent prepubescence, so it may be deduced that he somehow reproduced asexually. in sum, shankar is a man struggling to indefinitely delay his own sexual maturity, and thereby desperately clinging on to a simple, childlike innocence of all sexual matters.

raj aryan exists as the foil to narayan shankar, having arrived at gurukul with the singular purpose of altering shankar’s stunted outlook towards sexual maturity. in an allegorical sense, he portrays the biological agents and changes that act as messengers of puberty and sexual maturity, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormones and testosterone. visually, his urbane, well-dressed appearance, along with his suave and cultured manner, stands in contrast to the dull cluelessness of narayan shankar and his wards, and is indicative of his sexual confidence and maturity.

furthermore, his choice of musical instrument—the violin—is hardly coincidental. a violin requires precise, well-timed stroke-like movements to be made using a long, cylindrical piece of wood. the sight of raj aryan lounging comfortably in a chair and playing the violin with long, languid strokes, whilst wearing an expression of both contentment and pleasurable exertion, is certainly suggestive without appearing crass. the fact that his lover megha is deceased does not decrease raj aryan’s passion in the slightest, as she makes an appearance in his imagination every time he leans back, closes his eyes, and handles his violin. through such a combination of clever visual double entendres, the film conveys raj aryan’s use of masturbation and masturbatory fantasies as a healthy outlet for sexual expression and release.

to gurukul’s ignorant masses, raj aryan is nothing short of a revelation. like a masturbatory pied piper, he draws the ignorant, curious, and hypnotized students to his lessons, where he impresses upon them the need to break free of gurukul’s restrictive confinements and open their hearts and prostate glands to the power of love. in a metaphorical sense, he encourages the students to accept the changes coursing through their bodies, and let puberty begin to run its course. 

to best educate gurukul’s students, raj aryan organises a secret dance ball, inviting over students from a neighbouring women’s college. considering the allegorical nature of storytelling in *mohabbatein*, the college and its students are likely imaginary, and the secret dance ball is actually an educational musical lesson on some of the more practical and logistical aspects of masturbation. *yrf* films have always been renowned for making their song-and-dance routines an integral part of the story, and *mohabbatein* is no exception to this tradition of artistic excellence. as gurukul’s students shuffle into the dance ball, raj aryan takes the centre stage and croons, ‘aankhein khuli ho ya ho band/deedar unka hota hai/kaise kahoon main o yaara ye/pyaar kaise hota hai’, with the lyrics making it clear that while there are many paths to self-pleasure, the path one takes does not matter so long as the destination is the same. with sufficient practice, a master of the art may hone his skills to the point where imagination is all that is required. meanwhile, the less-skilled are free to keep their eyes open and rely on whatever visual aids they may prefer. bearing in mind the wide variety of means and techniques employed, it is not for one man to tell another how best to beat his meat.

this educational demonstration, however, is cut short upon the surprise appearance of narayan shankar, who discovers raj aryan's attempt to arouse gurukul’s pupils to rebellion against his rules. shankar uses his authority to turn raj aryan’s movement temporarily flaccid, but a defiant raj aryan takes up shankar’s opposition as a challenge, and vows to bring about love in every heart, a cramp in every right hand, and a scraggly hair sprouting from every smooth chin. raj aryan begins his campaign by asking gurukul’s pupils to each write a love letter upon orange maple leaves. the orange maple leaf is a common visual theme throughout the movie, and for good reason—a maple leaf with its five lobes bears an uncanny resemblance to an outstretched palm with its five fingers, coloured an inflamed red perhaps due to excessive use. thus, the act of writing a love letter upon an orange maple leaf is a clever visual metaphor for the students actually expressing gratitude and affection towards their own hands for the newly-discovered joys their hands have provided them with.

however, the ever-vigilant narayan shankar eventually catches onto raj aryan’s actions, and realizes that his fearsome gaze is no longer capable of wilting students’ defiant boners. faced with this prospect, a desperate shankar begins expelling students, hoping to discourage their peers and raj aryan, and therefore stave off the advent of puberty and sexual maturity amongst his wards. this leads to the film’s climax, wherein a gratuitously dripping-wet raj aryan meets shankar, and defiantly tells him that whilst he may have won the battle, he has lost the war, for despite all his authority, shankar will be forever left alone, because he lacks the powers of imagination and fantasizing that raj aryan possesses. raj aryan then reveals to shankar that despite the death of megha (shankar’s daughter, it may be remembered), he still fantasizes about her with perfect clarity. however, as previously mentioned, shankar had likely reproduced asexually to sire megha, and asexual reproduction leads to genetically-identical offspring. a horrified shankar realizes that therefore, by masturbating to megha—his clone—raj aryan has been indirectly masturbating to shankar himself for the past several years. left shaken by this discovery of the transitive properties of masturbation, a broken shankar is unable to recover from his shock and resigns as headmaster of gurukul, leaving raj aryan to take the helm and finally bring about his purpose to a glorious conclusion.

over two decades after release, *mohabbatein* stands alone in indian cinema. few films have ever attempted such deftly-layered storytelling in treatment of such delicate subject matter. indeed, if the bar were ever raised, it was only by *yrf*’s own other creations in subsequent years. no other films, however, have ever had the courage and wit to portray sex-ed as *mohabbatein* so well did, and if the subject shall ever make an appearance in the educational curriculum, there can be no doubt that *mohabbatein* shall be required viewing for all students, educators, and educational policymakers."

reddit,2024-01-16 08:05:58,"observation about bangalore traffic jams this is a comment i posted on reddit. putting the same here also. 

i have been to all indian metropolitan cities. bangalore is the best city. but the worst traffic jams. horrible mumbai traffic looks like a small roadblock compared to the ones in bangalore. 

so my views on how to solve is - 

i am in delhi. i have traveled to bangalore multiple times. i will explain what i observed.


1. delhi metro - is world class in terms of quality and connectivity. it beats new york and london. only below shanghai. it's safe reliable. 


and best part is whole of delhi, noida (uttar pradesh) and gurgaon (haryana) is covered. it's affordable. pretty much the whole ncr can be travelled in a metro. it has a system length of 400 kms + and ever expanding. 

i will give you an example. i live in rk puram (delhi) my friend works in an it company in uttar pradesh (noida) i take a metro. without exiting the system. i land in front of his it park in another state. that's efficiency. uber is useless in delhi because of efficiency of metro system. 

good metro and bus/end mile transport can out uber out of business. 

just imagine how indigo airlines beat indian railways? 

earlier upper middle class people used to use trains for journeys upto 1000 kms. now they use airplanes. 

first ac and second ac are empty on railways on long distance routes. because indian railway runs at 40 km per hour speed (even a moped can run faster) they are super slow. 100 trains on same tracks. 

but once india implements bullet trains - we can beat indigo. 

like this bangalore can beat uber and even rapido at its business. if we properly implement a mass rapid transit system with long term vision. 

we should think about next 100 years. 

bangalore metro is really bad. it goes to nowhere. even after the full system is developed bangalore metro would be far more inefficient than delhi.

when you look at delhi metro - it reduces 60 lakh cars per day on road. you can see a metro built with a long term vision. 

bangalore metro you can't see that vision. 

i can go to delhi airports with rs. 50 in 30 mins. same distance in bangalore is rs. 1000 in 190 mins. 

also in the future delhi's second mega airport noida jewar international airport will also be linked by metro. 

even more efficiency. 

2. public busses - bangalore needs atleast another 5000 buses for last mile connectivity.

3. affluence - bangalore is rich. yes this is problematic. even thou it's a good thing there is a problem of having too many upper middle clasw ane rich people.

delhi has a lot of poor people, lower middle class people (working in unorganised) 

bangalore has a too much of upper middle class people. and all of them have cars. bangalore employment is generated by it sector. and it sector in general pays 300% above unorganised manufacturing etc which delhi has.

because of very high pay in it sector (compared to other industries) other industres (low paying) cannot survive in bangalore. that's what happened in bay area in california. 

super poor poor and lowering middle class people are comparatively a lot less in bangalore. thanks to it sector, advanced manufacturing, high tech industries etc. also neighboring states like kerala, tamil nadu are also rich. 

in south india there are three metropolitan cities - bangalore, hyderabad and chennai. while in north india there is only delhi as a metropolitan city. 

bangalore has a lot of affluent well to do people (6 lakhs per year +) delhi doesn't have that.

and bangalore crowd is aspirational and young which means they are gonna buy a credir card. even if on credit card.

e.g of affluence being a problem - singapore. singapore only has 250 km road. but it has 30 lakh rich people. because of which singapore almost banned owning a car. in singapore if you want to buy a 10 lakh rupee car. you have to buy a 50 lakh permit. 

problem is singapore has too many upper middle class class people and it's a small island. imagine singapore having 30 lakh cars? it only has 250 kms of road in the whole country. 

london is still struggling even thou they implemented erp (electronic road ricing) 


what's the solution

1. metro - expand it thinking for the next 100 years. run it till the airport.

delhi meteo even goes to neighboring states like uttar pradesh and haryana. blr metro should definitely be expanded to neighboring districts atleast. 

2. extreme parking fees.

massively fine (5000 rs per instance) for cars which are parked illegally. 

3. erp or electronic road pricing. if you are riding on any congested road. it's going to be super costly. (100 rs per hour per car) 

price it with fast tag. 

cars are the biggest problem. occupy too much space. even bikes and buses are not.

i understand many people here on this sub-reddit uses cars. but the thing is it's impossible for 30 lakh cars to ply on blr roads. 

4. expand reliable public transport 24 * 7. add atleast 5000 buses.

make small commutter buses also. 

make guards and police available everywhere. women should also feel safe. unless women, children feel safe. public transport is useless cause they will use car/uber. 

make buses available at every pub, bar, movie theater and night club late night. 

public transport should also be useful to everyone. it should nor just exist just that a office transport. 

in delhi you can see rich couples going for dates on metros. 

delhi metro is infact a hangout spot for couples. super wierd but it shows the trust people have on delhi metro. 

usually men have to take cab or cars to take girls to dates. 

in delhi and singapore men give flowers in metro system. 

with this, also make better pedestrian infrastructure. more secure walkable footpaths, cycle paths etc. 

make parks, markets in every neighborhoods. 

5. send all government officials for a foreign tour to singapore, shanghai and xiamen.

let them be inspired and learn basics of urban planning.

don't think it's a waste of money. lot of african countries are improving after thier leaders went to foreign trips and got inspired.

6. give building approvals only if they have enough car parking. no car parking no approval.

7. fine people buying cars without parking in apartment.

steal money from people who use cars and invest the same in public transport infrastructure. 

also at midnight tow all vehicles parked outside apartment and fine them massively. or make electric parking meters.

8. also make share autos and share cabs legal. bangalore recently banned carpooling which is idiotic. 

also cabs, autos - make it costly to get permits to ride in the city. 

9. lastly, invest in road infra too - make more highways, express ways etc. 

it's a growing country. bangalore can't be stopped. tech industry is the future. which means bangalore is the future. 

no other city can beat bangalore in tech,  talent available in bangalore for tech is as good as talent available in shenzen for manufacturing, bay area for tech or london for finance. 

future is tech. and tech industry works by agglomeration. unfortunately we can't decentralise tech industry development. because of that bangalore will rapidly grow over next 50 years. just like bay area in california. bangalore will have some extreme growth. 

solution is to plan ahead with a vision. and not to be anti industry or anti population. 

bangalore will expand unless bangalore itself commit suicide like how kolkata/west bengal killed itself. 

back in the day 1950s  kolkata was a big deal and bengal was poised to become germany within india. but people and government of bengal decided to commit suicide by kicking out businesses and industries. now bengal is an industrial wasteland with no future and it's people migrating out. 

that's not the solution. we should embrace people and business. that's how bangalore can beat any global cities. overpopulation will happen. but we should not be sad about it. economics work on basis of agglomeration. we should embrace it and make excellent mass rapid transit system like delhi, singapore and shanghai. 

everytime i travel to bangalore. i believe harsh measures must be taken.

again, also public transport should be improved. a lot.

without that harsh measures only make people's lives horrible.

views are personal."

reddit,2024-01-17 23:22:05,"how i improved railways for thousands of people with my phone **i want to share with everyone all the amazing things they can do with** [ **railmadad app**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cris.railmadad&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us) **while sitting at their home.**

many might know the app can be used to complain for train delay and railway related stuff but you can use it to complain for all the stuff related to railway while being anonymous. to remain anonymous, download the app and create an account with a dummy email account, you can get email from mailinator website. when asked to register, choose email and don't provide phone number and you can stay anonymous with your complaints. so i complained regarding 5 things till now and have seen amazing results.

1. the complaint was regarding a major junction station having 7-8 counters and the attendant would close the counter all the time and sip tea and gossip while only 2 counters would be open even during rush hour. i complained against them on the station section of the app and i got a reply that railways would look into this allegation and punish them and take action and they actually did. now all the counters are open all the time. this is a common issue at every station so do complain, things will change wherever you are in india, it works for small stations with 2 counters as well.
2. second complaint was against dirty toilets and not cleaning them properly and they took action against the agent who was charging money for toilet and not cleaning it up to the standard. the toilets were much cleaner than before.
3. this was regarding train running slow and they actually covered 2 hrs delay after the complaint.
4. i asked the railway to put a ticket vending machine placed at my local station because there was long queue every morning. this is a small station and has only 2 platforms. i went to the station master and told him that we need a ticket vending machine and he was amused by my request. he said such a small station don't get vending machine. i told him to give me the complaint book which each station master have or take my application request for it. i took a paper and pen out and he was taken aback. he said there is no need to complain and he will see what he can do and in a week a new machine was put up. you can do the same from the app as well, i found this later.
5. this is the one no one would ever think of that they can get railways to do this but you need to be a little persistant and they will do it. you can get railways to fix the road at every railway crossing and repair the road of the bridge if railway lines run under it. many don't know this but railways own and maintain the road and bridges where tracks run so they are the one who will always fix it. if you have seen road repairs being done they never cross the height barrier crossing that is before the tracks because the land is owned by railways. so at a railway crossing the railway staff did some work on the tracks and dug up all the gravel and left it at that. the crossing was full of big gravels which was causing difficulty for everyone driving and the railway didn’t care to fix it for 1 month. i thought i should complaint regarding it and i did and told them that the bad road is causing accidents and people to fall over the tracks and tyres getting stuck on the track which could lead to major accident. the thing about the people looking the complaint always close the issue with some copy paste reply as soon as possible, maybe they have to work on the ticket or have timeline to close it so they do it immediately without even working or fixing the issue. i got a reply that they will look into it. they added some big blocks to make the road a little stable but the problem persisted so i complained again next month that work isn’t done and i mentioned the last ticket no. as well. i got a reply in 30 mins that they have floated the tender to repair road and it will get fixed soon. i was excited that i found out that i can fix railway crossing as well from the app. nothing happened for 1 more month so i complained again mentioning the older ticket no. and this time they said the same thing that they will look into it. after the fourth month i complained again that nothing has happened and this time they said work is being done on the track though the work on that section was completed previously and they will do the repair. i finally gave up and thought they won’t do anything now. after two months of no repairs after my last complaint, finally they did it, they repaired the road, not sure it was because of the complaints or they did it on their own but i believe that my complaint fastened the process because the govt is always slow. 

moral of the story -  **the govt will work, the govt will listen to you if you speak up and get your voices heard to the right people**. do not be afraid that someone will target or harass you for complaining. i have done several complaints and no one has ever harassed me or called me. please do not mistake the govt to do things on their own. just like any other employee, the govt employee will only do what they are told to do and they would never take the initiative on their own to make anything better.

reddit,2024-01-18 20:24:06,"how i made powercuts drop from 1 hr each day to 5 mins a week with my phone my last post[ how i improved railways for thousands of people with my phone](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1992u2t/how_i_improved_railways_for_thousands_of_people/) got a lot of love so i would like to share more such tips for everyone to benefit from it.

i live in wb and my electricity provider is wbsedcl. its a 100% govt owned company of wb govt. my area had a problem of power cuts. everyday there was 1 hour long power cuts and i was annoyed by it. i felt i needed to do something about it. my father told me that i can register complaint on its ivr with my consumer id no., so everytime power went out, i registered a complaint and they fixed the issue in 30 mins everytime. i did some research and found[ vidhyut sahyogi app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.wbsedcl.sahayogi&amp;hl=en_in&amp;gl=us) **.** for those who don't know, its the official app made by wbsedcl. you can complain on the app for powercuts by clicking 4 buttons and within 10 mins the power comes back always. you can also call on their helpline no. and register complaint as well but i find the app easier. when the cyclone hit wb last time, i registered a complaint and my area got power within 2 hrs after the cyclone stopped while the people living across the road got power after 1.5 days because they didn't complain and waited for things to happen on their own. the thing is they have to close the complain for power cut asap so they fixed my area first and then worked on other areas. the app has not been updated so you might not find it on your playstore because its way too old version or your phone doesn't supports it but you can find apk and use it, the servers are still running and they fix the problem asap. **you can call 19121 to register powercut complaints and get them fixed in 30mins.**

now this method worked fine and the power was back in 15-30 mins but i wanted no power cuts. everyone told me stop thinking that i live in new york and demand such things but i was adamant that i too deserve good facilities and i will get it somehow.

during the durga puja. power cuts were rampant and this time i called the electric office to ask why there are so many power cuts, the man rudely told me its puja time and they were laying wires for pandals and told me basically to deal with it. he said this will go on for the entire month. i was furious. i went to the wbsedcl official site and registered a complaint in their complaint section telling them about the same song sung by every govt dept in wb during pujas, ""kaaj puja pore hobe"" (work will be done after puja is over). i also mentioned powercuts happened everyday and it caused a lot of inconvience to all the schools, hospitals, businesses etc. and asked them to look into this issue. i did not think anyone would read or do anything but to my surprise when power cut happened next day they fixed it in 10 mins and called me to confirm if the power is back. they did not usually called to confirm if power was back. it was the same man and he was very polite this time. he told me if there is any powercut or any issue then i should let him know and it is his job to fix any issue. i was surprised by the sudden change in his behaviour.  after a few days it hit me that i placed a complaint and it might be the result of that. after my email complaint, we seldom lost power during the entire puja season.after the puja were over they started telling people that power will be out for a few hours as they are upgrading the system and to bear it a bit, previously they never cared about communicating this and used to cut power whenever they pleased for whatever purpose. after they upgraded the transformers, wires and poles, power is usually never out for more than 5 mins in a week. during the winter we haven't had any power cuts till date and all this is because of the upgradation of wires, poles, and transformer which happened because i emailed them and told them my issue and explained it was hampering work of several people and businesses. my one complaint improved the lives of thousands and got a lot of business to grow and prosper. all this happened because one person felt that he too deserved a better life and utilities and was adamant on getting it.

now you might be thinking, its a good success story but you don’t live in wb or wbsedcl provides you power. what can you do about the same issue which you face in your state. i will tell you what to do and how to improve your utilities. 

1. go to the website of your electricity provider and get the customer support no. and complain you have issue with power cuts. 
2. register a complaint on the website.
3. find the email of all the top officials ceo,md,cto etc., of the electricity board and generate an email using chatgpt and email them. 
4. provide the email to your friends and ask them to forward it as well.
5. register a complaint on cmo portal for rampant power cuts and ask them to fix the problem permanently. (i will post about it later, how i fixed roads, garbage, drains etc using it)

thats it, that is all you need to do and all the above you can do it with your phone while sipping coffee. take 10 mins out and do the above and you would live years of comfortable life like i am living now. do not be afraid that someone will call or harass you for complaining, no one has ever called or harassed me for complaining and i have complained for tons of stuff and got them fixed.

**moral of the story - every relationship requires proper communication.the relationship of the govt and its citizens is so weak because people never communicate their issues and expect govt to magically solve all issues**. do not think nothing will change, give it atleast one try, try atleast one email or one complaint. if nothing changes try 2-3 more times but at the end of the day you would be able to say to yourself that you tried, even though you failed but atleast you tried, which is more than others could ever say to themselves."

**the comptroller and auditor general  (cag) has transferred officers, including three who were coincidentally  involved with and in charge of two of the twelve key audit reports that  were presented in parliament during the monsoon session.**

**these twelve cag reports revealed corruption and irregularities  in the functioning of several union government ministries and  departments.the audit report revealed corruption in insurance settlement  claims. the report, among other findings, said that lakhs of claims  continued to be made against some who had been shown as ‘deceased’ in  the database.**

**the cag** [**report**](https://thewire.in/government/cag-report-nhai-toll-collection-railway-bharatmala-udan) on highway projects **found huge overrun costs in the dwarka expressway project**.the **report also found irregularities in the award of projects.**

**apart from these two reports, the ten other cag reports also  highlighted several other irregularities in union government ministries.the cag report** conducted **on 41 randomly selected toll plazas across** the five  southern states **found that in five toll plazas, a total amount of rs  132.05 crore was collected from commuters** in violation of toll plaza  rules.the report **also found that the nhai collected excess toll fees of  rs 22.10 crore from road users** during 2017-2018 to 2020-2021 at the  paranur public-funded toll plaza.

**the cag report** on the financial audit of the accounts of the  union government found that \*\*the ministry of railways had incurred  unsanctioned expenditure.\*\*in the 2021-22 financial year (fy), the ministry had an  **unsanctioned expenditure of rs 23,885.47 crore, encompassing 1,937  cases**. **in fy 2020-21 unsanctioned expenditure of rs 8,127.97 crore was  incurred by indian railways in 2,775 cases.**

**subrahmanyam shared the information while speaking as a panelist at a  seminar on financial reporting in india,** which had been organised last  year by the **non-governmental think-tank the centre for social and  economic progress (csep).**

in **his remarks – another first by a government official – he revealed  how the federal budgets are “covered in layers and layers of attempt to  cover the truth”**. he added that **he was** **“sure you will have a hindenburg  who will open up the \[indian government’s\] accounts if they are  transparent”**.

he meant, **if the accounts were transparent,** **the truth of the  government’s fiscal condition** **would become evident,** similar to how the  adani group’s questionable accounting practices were highlighted by  us-based short seller hindenburg research."
reddit,2024-01-21 19:51:27,"confused between hybrid solar setup and on grid+seperate inverter dear all,
ive been researching this topic and haven't found a satisfactory understand yet. i am planning to get a solar energy setup done with nullify my electricity bills(and earn more by exporting extra units if possible).

i have decided to get a 5kw capacity solar (~500w x 10 panels). my monthly usage is about 350 to 400 units. 

i had initially planned to get 5kw hybrid setup hoping that i would be able to run 1 ac (1.5ton) when there would be power cut, but the solar vendor told ac, geyser etc won't work with hybrid setup incase of power cut. 

in this case, the whole reason of going hybrid fails. if i have to just get backup for lighting (or lightweight appliances), i could just get on-grid solar of 5kw setup and another standalone inverter for powerbackup of maybe 3 kw. would this make more sense to keep solar and backup part seperate? 

another question is is there any advantage of use hybrid solar setup (battery + export to grid) compared to on grid + standalone inverter of same capacity?

i'm finding the latter option 5kw on grid + 5kw inverter costs around 60k less than 5kw hybrid solar setup."

reddit,2024-01-24 05:55:18,"a call for prioritizing national development alongside cultural celebrations dear fellow citizens of india,

in a country as diverse and culturally rich as ours, the building of temples, churches, mosques, and other sacred places holds significant meaning. however, amidst our religious and cultural endeavors, it's crucial to recognize that these are not the most pressing issues we face today. as much as these structures symbolize our faith and traditions, their construction alone cannot address the urgent problems that demand our immediate attention.

as we stand at the crossroads of development and tradition, let us remember: we will always have time to rebuild and celebrate our sacred places, but the urgent needs of our society cannot wait. the safety of our women, the quality of our education system, and the basic amenities for every citizen are issues that require prompt and collective action.

in this endeavor, it's imperative that we, as people of diverse faiths and beliefs, avoid the trap of blaming one another. our strength lies in our unity, not in division. we must work together to build a nation that excels not only in its spiritual and cultural aspects but also in providing a safe, educated, and dignified life for all its citizens. it's time we support each other and speak out against any attempts to divide us for political gains. our goal should be a holistic development that uplifts every indian, transcending religious and cultural lines.

&amp;#x200b;

**women's safety: a fundamental right**

the nirbhaya case was a harrowing reminder of the perils women in india face daily. despite some progress, the question remains: can a woman walk alone at night on the streets of ayodhya, or any indian city, without fear? in 2019, the national crime records bureau (ncrb) reported over 400,000 cases of crimes against women across india. this staggering number, encompassing rape, domestic violence, and harassment, only reflects reported cases, with many incidents likely going unreported due to social stigma and fear. women's safety is not just a matter of law enforcement; it's about societal attitudes and the very fabric of our community. we must work together to create environments where women and girls feel safe and respected at all times.

**educational reforms: the backbone of our future**

quality education is the cornerstone of any progressive society. unfortunately, many of our government schools are plagued with issues like inadequate infrastructure and the lack of qualified teachers. instances such as in bihar's government schools, where a 2019 report revealed a shortage of over 280,000 teachers, highlight the urgent need for reform. additionally, schools in rural areas, like those in uttar pradesh's villages, often struggle with dilapidated buildings and insufficient learning materials. these conditions are a disservice to our children's education and their future.

**basic amenities: the foundation of dignity**

access to clean water, proper sanitation, and electricity is a fundamental human right. in places like lalpur village in madhya pradesh, residents have long suffered from a lack of clean drinking water. the situation in many urban slums, where open defecation is still a harsh reality due to the absence of toilets, poses serious health risks. furthermore, in 2020, it was reported that around 31 million homes in india were still without electricity, with villages in remote areas like those in odisha experiencing frequent power outages. these conditions hinder not only the daily life of residents but also the educational and economic development of their communities.

with this letter, i appeal to every indian, regardless of faith or background, to prioritize our collective welfare and progress. let's strive to build a nation where sacred places are revered, but not at the cost of ignoring the fundamental rights and needs of our people. together, we can build a new india that is not only a land of temples but also a beacon of hope, progress, and equality for all.

sincerely,    
fellow indian citizen"

reddit,2024-01-28 17:04:11,"how i fixed roads, drain, garbage &amp; hospital for lakhs of people with my phone **tl;dr - complain on your states chief minister office portal**

my last two posts motivated a lot of people to take action and improve their surroundings so i want to share today the most awaited post on how to improve roads, fix drains, clean garbage, improve hospitals and state govt instituitons while sitting at your home with just your phone.

there was a road in my area which was broken and full of potholes. it was dusty and used to get waterlogged. for 3 years i waited and hoped the govt would fix it eventually but nothing happened. last year i got frustrated and took it on myself to get it fixed. i did some research and found the road was owned and maintained by wb highway department. i went to their website, found their complaint email and emailed them them to fix the road. nothing happened and i never got a reply. i then went to pwd website and tried to complaint but nothing happened again.i tried every other way possible but i never got any success. finally someone told me about the cmo portal. the person worked in state govt office and told me that a complaint came from cmo office. the person who was not working on finding a persons documents and approving his request got called to his seniors office and she was on the verge of crying when she came out. the senior told her to find the file of that person by eod and he wants it done today. she was stalling the man with the request since it would take a lot of time to find the file. there were hundreds of files and action would be taken on her if she didn’t get the file by eod, that is why she was on the verge of crying. her colleague helped her and they finally submitted the file to the senior. in a week the mans request was approved which he had been trying for three months. this story gave me hope and i thought lets give it a try, i have failed trying for 6 months, what if i fail once more.

i went to the cmo portal of wb and found an email and placed a complaint. i waited and waited nothing happened for two weeks. i gave up hope. then i contacted the same person who told me the story and she told me to try calling the helpline no. instead since govt officers rarely check their emails. i was a little hesitant but i dialled the no., they took my basic information and registered my complaint. they assured me work will be done asap and not to worry about anything. in 2 weeks time i started receiving sms from wbcmo, the complaint was moving from seniors to lower level every 3-4 days. in 2 weeks they fixed the entire road. no one ever called me or harassed me for complaining. they simply did the work. my 7 months of research and failure finally got me success. i was thrilled beyond comprehension. i felt so proud that i made the govt work, i put an end to the suffering of thousands of people for 4 years straight to an end. i had finally found the holy grail and now i was determined more than ever to get all other things fixed as well.

1. **fixing potholes -** after the road was fixed. i called again the very next day and complained about 8-9 things at once. the cmo office was more than happy to take all my complaints. within a week another road with potholes was fixed.
2. **fixing rural/colony roads** \- my colony road was maintained by the members of my colony, the govt made roads for colonies all around our area but left us. i placed a complaint that our colony was being maintained by us and i want the govt to take this responsibility and build the road. i live in a panchayat and the complain was sitting for 3 months at the panchayat. finally i snapped and called the cmo and told my complaint was on hold for 3 months and nothing was done, i want to escalate the issue to higher up, the person on call told me govt work takes time and to wait a little longer. i told her if anything was progressing i would be happy but the complaint was laying dormant. she assured me she will look into it. after two days i got a call from my panchayat and they asked me to come meet them for the issue. i was not available so i sent my father and they started their same story like they don’t have funds and the govt doesn’t send them funds. then they gave me their personal no. and told to call them and tell them for any trouble and not to complain on cmo portal, saying it would take so long and work would never be done but if we called them they will try to put our request into their meetings and get the work done. my father said i don’t have a problem who does the work, my colony road getting fixed is all i want. they assured that they will do the necessary. this same story happened with [u/arav](https://www.reddit.com/user/arav/) [when he used cmo of maharastra to get his work done. the engineer got a notice from the ministry and fixed an issue and gave him his own number and told him to tell him about any problem instead of complaining on cmo portal. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/199rx95/comment/kijzvhf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)the reason is that if the complain stays dormant and action isn’t taken on it, the govt employees get a notice after 3-4 months so that is why they share their own number later so that the complaint doesn’t reaches the ministry. they know we know our right and how to get work done and if more people find out about this, more people would start complaining. this is the very same reason my panchayat gave me their personal no. and tried to dissuade me from complaining on cmo because they will put pressure to get work done and will take action or stop funding if the work isn’t being done.
3. **start garbage pickup and garbage disposal-** my area doesn’t have any garbage pickup or cleanup, people dump it in a pit and after a month they light it on fire to make more space. i wanted this to stop. i complained on cmo and and asked them to get a garbage pickup service started and dispose this garbage properly instead of just dumping it somewhere else. this one took 1 month but i got a call, they asked me my location and the person who called knew me. he said we are a panchayat and garbage pickup would be difficult since they don’t get enough funds. i told him we have lived here for 20+ years and this is just a basic thing we are asking, this should have been provided years ago. the municipal area does it, why can’t you do it. he said he will look into it. i called him 2 weeks later and asked if there was any progress, he said it will take around 3 months but they have got order from cmo to look for land and build proper garbage disposal and start the garbage pickup service in 3 months. the cmo was angry that the panchayat has existed for 50+ years and doesn’t have this service yet. with just my single complaint i have fixed a problem faced by the residence for 50+ years.
4. **fix drainage -** a road in my area has bad drainage and waterlogging is a problem faced here for 20+ years. though i live far away from the area but i wanted this issue to be fixed. i complained about the drainage being blocked and it was never cleaned so water doesn’t flows through it and waterlogged the entire road. for 3 months nothing happened and the issue was stuck in bdo office. i called cmo again and told them the issue was stuck. the very next day i got a call from bdo office and the lady was very polite. she asked me about the area and i told her. she said they spelled the area wrong that is why work wasn’t being done. she told she is sending people to get the drainage fixed. they came and saw the drainage requires complete rebuilding. they raised a tender and work started in a week. finally we won’t have drainage issue and waterlogging. this has impressed a lot of people living in that area and they are also calling cmo for their complaints.
5. **get roads cleaned up -** a road was always filled with sand because trucks didn’t cover the top properly and the sand would spill and collect over the road which was a hazard for vehicles. i complained and they passed an order to the trucks to cover properly and they got the roads cleaned.
6. **improve hospitals service and medicines -**  i complained that a govt hospital was only getting a 10-15 shots of rabbies medicine each day while the queue for it each day was for atleast 50 people. the medicine costs around rs 6000 according to someone i know in pvt hospitals and pharmacy. i told them there was no seats for patients to wait as well and to increase the medicine count. the govt took action and increased the medicine count.

you might be thinking that it is a great success story but what about my state. each state has a chief minister office portal. the quality and pace of work done by them may vary depending on the state but wb cmo is one of the best in the country, they have won several awards from centre for their work as well. for certain i know that wb &amp; maharashtra cmo gets work done if you complain. do a google search and you will find for your own state. you can complain in cmo for everything owned by the state govt. you can complain for bad service in your govt college, to improve hospitals, to fix roads, to clean garbage, to increase bus service or open any bus stop, you can complain and get traffic lights for roads, get cameras and street lights placed in unsecure areas. if you have any issue with theft in your area, you can register a complaint and tell them the police isn’t taking action to reduce thefts. you can complain against rto if they are holding your driving license, complain about pollution to pollution board.

moral of the story - **the govt will listen and act on your complaints. instead of cursing the govt for bad roads and dirty surrounding. complain to the topmost authority in your state which is the cmo portals. they will get the work done.** all it takes is 5 mins to complain that too can be done sitting at your home. i hope when the next time you are stuck in banglore traffic instead of cursing the govt, pick your phone and register a complaint, tell them to add more traffic lights or put a traffic police to maintain traffic. when the next rainfall happens in mumbai, instead of cursing the govt, tell them you want the drainage fixed, the problem to be fixed permanently."

reddit,2024-01-31 20:43:29,"water shortage in the city? before i moved to this property, i had read google reviews that said there was a water problem. the manager of my pg (which is part of a corporate setup), assured me that there was no water shortage issues in the building. it was a rather demeaning reaction as well, to my question of whether this issue exists. he said “not in this property, no”. that was in november, there has in fact been water shortage issues multiple times since then. however, since january began, the water situation is at an all time low, and every day, we use water scantily. we got a text from the company’s main pr team, that said there’s an overall depletion of water all around the city of bangalore and that’s why we’re facing the shortage as well. i don’t buy it, because i’ve had terrible experiences with management at corporate pgs. anyway, i wanna ask if this is the case every where, or if this is classic, poor management of the property."

reddit,2024-02-05 22:17:00,"new scam alert @ hsr havmour ice-cream noticed something super weird today at hsr 14th main road, sector 7 now. 


there were 4 havmour ice-cream carts on the street all spread out and guess what none of them had mrp price written on them. all the ice creams (literally every piece, every sku) had mrp price being deliberately removed or scratched off. 


when, i asked the first vendor he conveniently pretended that he had no idea why this was the case. he blamed it on the supplier and said he just sells. not being convinced, i felt i was being scammed with the inflated pricing for the ice-cream i decided to move ahead. this is when i saw another vendor, same stuff happened with the pricing. but this time the excuse was very straightforward - prices are cut out because i want to sell it at 5rs above mrp for.labour, cooling and so forth. i was convinced some shady stuff is being masterminded here. 

to my curiosity, i wanted to see if this was a one of case or literally everyone is doing this. i saw 2 more carts ahead on the same road and deliberately stopped to inquire the pricing. 

guess what all 3 vendors had a different pricing for the same ice-cream? i was like duh what is going on? 40?50?60rs? for the same icecream.

 when i confronted the last vendor about this aggressively he became defensive and started arguing back. i could see him getting agitated but he couldn't care less if i caught them. typical screw you attitude ""do what you can"". 

not that i have a problem paying 10rs extra or  whatever but the fact they have audacity to do it with a brand like havmour was outrageous. 

headups to everyone! don't understand why vendors in bangalore try  to scam at any moment? i admire this city so much but then this happens. 

can we report this to the right authorities? who will be in this case? 

peace"
reddit,2024-02-06 00:35:53,"bangalore's unmarked speed bumps are a menace. seeking inputs around the legality of installing reflectors by myself. hey folks

literally witnessed a teenager almost bleed to death because he wasn’t able to spot an unmarked speed bump on a dimly lit road. as you all know, this is a problem that plagues the entire city.


i’m thinking of taking matters into my own hands and installing [reflective road studs](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/i/510iq+7gewl._ac_uf1000,1000_ql80_.jpg). 

they aren't too expensive and it seems like they can be installed relatively easily using some industrial adhesives.   


wanted to understand the legalities of doing this on public roads + if any of y’all have more cost effective solutions in mind, please do share."

reddit,2024-02-06 13:30:14,"my dad my hero 
my dad passed away 3 years ago. to this day i feel like he is just living in another part of the world, that he is still with us. today is his birthday. the last of his birthday when he was with us, i spent at my hostel, studying for my exams. i sent him a cake which he cut with my family, where he included me in the pictures by holding the phone i was videocalling on. it's a very confusing day for me, i want to be happy and celebrate his life by thinking about the good stuff, but the feeling of him not being here suffocated real bad. so, i thought i would share a story from my childhood with all of you to celebrate what a marvelous man he was.


to set the background of the story, it was my mom's birthday. i love in a joint family so on anyone's birthday my mom, dad, me and my two cousins who were just like my real siblings, we would go have dinner at a nice hotel. we were not posh people by a long stretch, just a nice middle class family for whom these birthday dinners were very big deal. when i think back to that time i always think about the beauty of those small normal middle class things we would do. my parents were originally from village who had shifted to the city for the education of me and my cousins, they were easily the most learned and hardworking people i know to this date, and they only started taking us to these restaurants so that we children could develop with the developing world.


and we children we were so thankful for it, we would get our pocket money together and buy gifts for the birthday person, plan about the menu of the birthday dinner weeks in advance( still ending up ordering the same dishes every time), watch my dad pay the huge bill with wide eyes. those were the best of times.


then one day dominos opened up in my city. it  was the talk of the town, before this we had only seen pizza in hindi movies. domino's was the epitome of coolness in our eyes. we planned and planned for weeks, because domino's was in the route of the restaurant we used to go for dinner. then we went to mom and told her that we wanted to get one pizza after the birthday dinner. mom told us to ask dad in the car after the dinner, and he would be in a happy mood so he would definitely buy us one. cue to us fighting over who is going to ask dad.


the dinner went well, but that day our heart was only beating for domino's. i still remember peeking at the restaurant bill, it was 1037 rupees, and i thought that that's huge, but not so bad that we can't ask for pizza. now we three are in the backseat of our car giggling "" papa pizza"" in the lowest of voices, wanting it but too shy to ask for it. my dad asked us what we were giggling about. my sister bravely told dad about domino's. he was a simple man, he asked us questions about what is domino's and what is a pizza, we answered enthusiastically. he took us to the domino's while mom waited in the car. the three of us were so amazed by that place we only used to see in movies.


dad took us to the counter to order, but we were so shy because of course the workers working there have to be people especially trained in us by special magicians to make pizza ( or so we thought in our minds).
my dad sensed our hesitation and started talking to the guy on the counter, who gave him the menu, when dad showed it to us, we of course told him how we wanted the cheapest option. he ordered it for us and we were in heaven thinking about having it as a late night snack when we got home. but then, my dad looked at the menu again, and ordered another pizza for us, not the cheapest one, and some coke to go with it. and that kindness he showed us, it blew my mind. standing there while the pizzas baked, i could only think about how manganimous that gesture was for a middle class person who had just spent so much on a meal. and the confidence with which he talked to those workers, wow.


some of u may read this story and think it was just a simple interaction, but today i am a confident 27 yr old woman. today those same cousins who were with me that day, don't talk to me or my mom because we are no longer the golden hen to slaughter after my dad passed away. today i don't have that amazing man to hold my hand through life. and i take care of myself and my mom, i do it all with confidence and magnanimity. i show kindness to little kids of my family the same way my dad did. and so many times, i close my eyes, and i go back to that interaction at domino's, and gain power from it. our parents make us what we are. and today on my dad's birthday i just wanna say that he made me absolutely awesome."

reddit,2024-02-09 22:57:38,"how to get power back in 10 mins in banglore after powercut i made this post about a month ago about how i improved the electricity supply in my area and powercut dropped from 1hr daily to 5 mins a week - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/s/9mf1evn3md

i wanted to test if it works as well as in karnataka as it works in wb and to my surprise it actually does. if you have a powercut or powercut problem in your area then just dial 1912. tell the bescom provider that you have a power cut, you can either tell them about the area where powercut has happened or just give your consumer id. they will create a docket and the electrician will come and fix the issue asap. for those who prefer apps instead, download the bescom mithra app, can't tell about the effectiveness of the app yet but calling them definitely works. it does not end there, i saw many powerlines and poles in very bad state and over drains which might be hazardous and prone to accidents. you can also complain against it and they will come and fix it instead of waiting for something bad to happen for them to take notice of the issue.

power cuts may be rare and might not last long but if you raise a complaint it will definitely get solved instead of waiting for them to fix it on its own."

## tl;dr

both houses of the parliament were adjourned  sine die on february 10, 2024, concluding the 2024 budget session one  day after the scheduled end date of february 09, and the last  parliamentary session for the 17th lok sabha. during this session, 10  new bills were introduced for passing, of which 12 were passed by both  houses, 1 pending passage in the rajya sabha, with a total of 24 bills  pending after the conclusion of the session. the union interim budget  for 2024-25 was presented and passed. we see increased budgetary  allocations in the budget for meity, mha, mib and dot as compared to the  2023-2024 budget, which is a good starting point for building and  implementing robust digital systems. discussions on the floor of the  parliament spanned several issues, including those relevant to digital  rights and freedoms.

## background

the 15th  parliamentary session of the 17th lok sabha was adjourned sine die on  february 10, 2024, concluding one day after the scheduled end date of  february 09. this marks the last parliamentary sitting for the 17th lok  sabha, as we prepare to elect a new government in the upcoming general  elections. in the session, union minister nirmala sitharaman presented  the union interim budget for the financial year (“fy”) 2024-2025, which  was passed in both houses. the budget is an interim allocation of funds  until india forms a new union government in the 2024 lok sabha  elections, post which a full budget will be placed in both houses for  deliberation again in july 2024. a cumulative sum of ₹1,43,337.88 cr has  been allotted to the ministry of electronics and information technology  (meity), the ministry of information and broadcasting (mib), the  department of telecommunications (dot), and ministry of home affairs  (mha). see our detailed analysis of the budget for these ministries in [this blogpost](https://internetfreedom.in/budget-2024-part-ii/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

both  houses introduced 10 bills, passed 12 and withdrew none. the bills  passed in both houses and now awaiting presidential assent include the  finance bill, 2024 which gives effect to tax proposals of the central  government for the year 2024-25 and 5 appropriation bills. the other  bills passed are the water (prevention and control of pollution),  amendment bill, 2024, public examination (prevention of unfair means)  bill, 2024, jammu and kashmir local bodies laws (amendment) bill, 2024,  constitution (scheduled tribes) order (amendment) bill, 2024,  constitution (scheduled castes and scheduled tribes) orders (amendment)  bill, 2024, constitution (jammu and kashmir) scheduled castes order  (amendment) bill, 2023; constitution (jammu and kashmir) scheduled  tribes order (amendment) bill, 2023. read more about this session’s  legislative business [here](https://prsindia.org/files/parliament/session_track/2024/session_wrap/session_wrap-budget_session_2024.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

the  lok sabha and rajya sabha observed productivity rates of 148% and 137%  respectively. however, a majority of their time (44-47%) was spent  discussing non-legislative business, and a fraction of time (8-9%)  actually went into discussing and answering questions. while the union  interim budget was passed after 7 hours 6 minutes of discussion in the  lok sabha and 6 hours 37 minutes discussion in the rajya sabha, both  houses spent between 3-5 hours discussing agenda item 'historic  construction of shree ram temple and pran pratishta' on the final day of  the parliament. these statistics are available [here](https://prsindia.org/sessiontrack/budget-session-2024/productivity?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and [here](https://prsindia.org/sessiontrack/budget-session-2024/important-issues?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

## quick overview: union interim budget 2024-25

union  interim budget for fy 2024-25 has cumulatively allotted ₹1,43,337.88 cr  to the ministry of electronics and information technology (meity), the  ministry of information and broadcasting (mib), the department of  telecommunications (dot), and ministry of home affairs (mha). a glance  at ministry-wise budget estimates (“be”) and revised estimates (“re”)  shows us that for the meity, allocation in be 2024-2025 (₹21,385.15 cr)  saw an increase of 48.28% as compared to the re of 2023-24 (₹14,421.25  cr); for the mha, allocation in be 2024-2025 (₹5733.51 crores) saw an  increase of 11.97% as compared to the re of 2023-24 (₹5120.78 cr), for  the mib, allocation in be 2024-2025 (₹4342.55 cr) saw a decrease of  2.41% as compared to the re of 2023-24 (₹4449.76 cr), for the dot,  allocation in be 2024-2025 (₹1,11,876.67 cr) saw an increase of 13.74%  as compared to the re of 2023-24 (₹98,359.41 cr).

an enormous  17.15% increase in total planned capital expenditure of dot, meity, mha,  and mib (₹1,43,337.88 cr) over the re of 2023-24 (₹1,22,351.2 cr) can  be observed, stemming largely from a 48.28% increase in the ministry of  electronics and information technology (meity). the increment can be  attributed to meity’s capital allocation towards the modified programme  for development of semiconductors and display manufacturing ecosystem in  india, which saw a whopping 359.1% increase as compared to 2023-24.

## ministry-wise overview

1. **meity:** the  total budgetary allocation for meity in the budget for 2024-2025 is  ₹21385.2 cr, which is a 29.2% increase from the previous financial  year’s budget. the increase is even higher when compared to the re of  2023-2024, i.e., a year-on-year change of 48.28%. this is in contrast to  the budgetary trends we witnessed in 2021, 2022 and 2023, where there  was underutilisation of the budget.

&amp;#x200b;

* **dot**: in 2024-25, the department  (which operates under the ministry of communications) has been allocated  a whopping ₹111876.6 cr, which is 14.65% increase over the budget  allocated in 2023-24 (₹97579.05 cr) and 13.74% over the re for 2023-24  (₹98359.41 cr). notably, no funds have been allocated for the defence  spectrum, for which dot estimated a large amount of ₹2285.32 cr last  year, but utilised only 13.8% of it (₹315.55 cr).

https://preview.redd.it/76z7esge45ic1.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1cffbfdc79ede2ca56252b6e10f40cabfe334de

&amp;#x200b;

* **mib:** the total budgetary allocation  for mib in 2024-25 is ₹4342.55 cr, which is a 7.45% decrease from the  2023-2024 budget. this cut comes after mib seemingly was able to utilise  a higher budget allocation last year, which seems incongruent. the  allocation for central sector schemes/projects under mib has plateaued  as compared to the be 2023-2024.

https://preview.redd.it/mrdj24eg45ic1.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb3c4243f6dc84e35908a2ab87d56282146af183

&amp;#x200b;

* **mha:** the total budgetary allocation  for mha is 2.84% lower than what was allocated in the be for the fy  2023-24. the allocation in the budget estimates, net of receipts and  recoveries, for mha is ₹5733.51 cr. although there is a 11.97% increase  over the 2023-24 re that was pegged at ₹5120.78 cr, the allocation is  still 13.22% lower than what was made in 2023-24. the allocation for  planned capital expenditure has marginally dipped as compared to both  the 2023-2024 be ( by 1.27%) and re (by 6.21%), which is disappointing.

## questions, answers, and discussions

### digi yatra implementation and data security

on  february 05, niranjan reddy asked the ministry of civil aviation in the  rajya sabha for insights on passenger data collection via digi yatra,  measures taken to prevent unauthorised access/misuse, and whether  passengers have visibility and control over their data, incl right to  access, rectify &amp; delete data, as well as the ministry’s plans to  place digi yatra under govt oversight for enhanced security and  transparency. the minister of state answered that the digiyatra central  ecosystem prioritises privacy by design and default and all personal  passenger data is stored locally in the passenger’s smartphone wallet  itself. he added that data is shared with the origin airport for id  validation and purged within 24 hrs post-flight departure, and that the  government ensures data security and process transparency in digi yatra  by maintaining passenger data locally only and purging it from the  central system. 

however, this does not solve a central issue with  digiyatra, which lacks transparency in its data flow and sharing  practices, with vague privacy policy provisions and discrepancies in  officials' statements. neither its nodal authority nor auditing body,  which is the indian computer emergency response team (“cert-in”)  falls  under the rti act. read iff’s detailed analysis on digi yatra [here](https://internetfreedom.in/reject-digiyatra/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

### regulation of deepfakes

on  february 05, parliamentarian harbhajan singh asked meity if it is  cognizant of the risks associated with disruptive technologies such as  artificial intelligence (“ai”) and deepfakes, and their plans to enact  regulations in these domains. minister of state replied that the  government’s internet policies prioritise an open, safe and accountable  online space for all “digital nagriks”, and that they plan to leverage  the potential of ai for innovation across sectors while being mindful of  its risks, especially in the case of deepfakes. 

he stated that  as for regulation the it (intermediary guidelines and digital media  ethics code) rules, 2021 (“it rules, 2021”) obligate intermediaries to  promptly address misinformation, which includes deepfakes. under these  rules certain grievance appellate committees are set up to ensure a  user-friendly redressal, and the ministry adopts a zero-tolerance stance  on deepfakes which mandates platforms to align their terms of use and  swiftly remove prohibited content. he added that recent advisories of  the ministry emphasise compliance with it rules, 2021 for  intermediaries, while users are being informed about content guidelines  and potential legal consequences. the national cyber crime reporting  portal and helpline are also available for grievance redress. 

as  deepfakes took centre stage in 2023, meity decided to tackle the issue  head-on. however, what ensued was several conflicting statements from  meity and rushed interventions without deeply understanding or  consulting over the issues, which is not the best-suited response to  systemic issues like deepfakes. read iff’s analysis on this issue [here](https://internetfreedom.in/dealing-with-deepfakes/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).  further, grievance appellate committees are not the solution to the  problem – they worryingly make the government an arbiter of permissible  speech on the internet and incentivise social media platforms and  intermediaries to suppress any speech unpalatable to the government.  read more of iff’s work on gacs under the it rules, 2021 [here](https://internetfreedom.in/public-brief-on-the-it-amendment-rules-2022/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

### internet and child mental health

on  february 02, in lok sabha, parliamentarian shashi tharoor asked the  ministry of women and child development about their awareness of surveys  done on the mental health concerns prevalent among internet-using  children, and steps taken to address the issue, especially by the kerala  government where the rates are worryingly high. minister of state  answered that the government does not know of the survey, but studies  have been done by the national commission for protection of child rights  on the effects of mobile phone and internet usage on school children  which suggest similar trends. she added that the government addresses  mental health burden in children through the national mental health  programme and rashtriya kishor swasthya karyakram, focused on holistic  adolescent development with mental health as a key area. this is  supported by the ayushman bharat school health and wellness programme  and a national tele mental health programme with 34 states/uts already  offering tele-mental health services, handling over 6,28,000 calls.

### rural connectivity and digital panchayats

on  february 06, in lok sabha,parliament damore guman asked the ministry of  panchayati raj about their plans for technological advancements in  panchayati raj institutions (“pri”), status of ftth internet  connectivity in pris in madhya pradesh, how long until remaining gram  panchayats have internet access, and the ministry’s efforts to raise  digital literacy among newly elected representatives. minister of state  replied that egramswaraj app enhances transparency in panchayat  governance, with 2.52l pris uploading development plans and 2.41l  completing online transactions for grants. auditonline ensures  accountable finances, with 2.49l audit plans created. he added that  bharatnet aims to connect all pris with broadband and 2,14,300 are  presently service-ready. a ‘model panchayat citizens charter’ ensures  timely services for citizens, and over 2.32l gram panchayats have  conducted gram sabha to facilitate this. on digital literacy efforts, he  stated that the revamped rashtriya gram swaraj abhiyan empowers  panchayats through technical training for elected representatives,  focusing on governance capabilities and sdg localisation at grassroots level. 

### regulatory scope of dpdpa

on  february 07, in lok sabha, parliamentarian tenkasi asked meity about  the key objectives of digital personal data protection (“dpdp”) act  2023, its impact on personal data processing in india, and its scope to  advance india's ai adoption while safeguarding personal data. further,  he asked how the government is ensuring companies comply with redressal  mechanisms and penalties under the act, what steps are being taken to  educate citizens about their statutory rights and what measures are in  place to ensure compliance by data fiduciaries. minister of state  answered that the dpdp act focuses solely on protection of personal data  &amp; establishes rights and duties of data principals and obligations  of data fiduciaries – including safeguarding personal data against  breaches &amp; fostering responsible data processing practices. he added  that the act establishes a data protection board to penalise  non-compliance, ensuring accountability and imposing fines on processors  violating data protection standards and that a transition period of  6-12 mos will be provided for them to adapt and comply to the new  regime. 

the dpdp act in its current form is flawed on many  aspects – it makes personal data vulnerable to online scraping, has weak  notice requirements, gives sweeping exemptions to govt and private  actors in unclear circumstances, imposes penalties on data principals,  and so on. further, the public consultation process for the current  version is flawed, as it was tabled and passed in the parliament without  specific consultations and though its previous version was open for  feedback from the public, the suggestions were not publicly displayed,  neither were they incorporated, at least not in a transparent manner.  iff has done a deeper analysis on the act, which can be [accessed here](https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-first-read-of-the-draft-digital-personal-data-protection-bill-2023/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

### voter card linking with aadhaar

on  february 09, several lok sabha members asked the ministry of law and  justice about the number of voter ids linked with aadhaar since the  election laws (amendment) act, 2021 and how consent is being obtained  for the same. they also inquired about how a voter’s aadhaar details  will be deleted upon withdrawal of consent and if the names of voters  not linked with aadhaar will be removed from voter lists. further, they  asked about the measures put in place to safeguard the voter database  from misuse. minister of state replied saying that the election  commission of india (“eci”) has previously clarified that the  representation of the people act, 1950, as amended by the election laws  act, 2021, permits electoral registration officers to request aadhaar  numbers from electors voluntarily for identity verification. he added  that starting august 01, 2022, a voluntary aadhaar collection program  has been initiated nationwide but linking of aadhaar with election photo  identity cards has not commenced yet. for now, submitting aadhaar with  voter id is optional, with consent obtained via form 6b. currently there  are no provisions for deleting aadhaar details if consent is withdrawn.  the eci oversees electoral roll preparation and ensures data security  through multi-layered encryption.

### one nation, one student id

on  february 05, parliamentarians asked the education ministry for clarity  on the “one nation, one student id” initiative, including the objectives  of the initiative, measures to ensure student data confidentiality, and  guidelines to prevent data breaches. minister of state for education  replied that under the framework, a ‘registry framework’ tracks  students’ academic journeys, facilitates credit transfers, and aligns  programs with skill components. stringent data security measures under  meity’s guidelines will ensure confidentiality and prevent data  breaches. iff has previously flagged the framework for the privacy  concerns it raises, which persist despite the minister’s assurances.  read our analysis [here](https://internetfreedom.in/aadhaar-based-student-id-raises-alarms-for-privacy/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

there were other discussions that we tracked live, including on [data collection through aarogya setu](https://x.com/iffonparliament/status/1755944028858675574?s=20&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in), linking of [aadhaar with health schemes](https://x.com/iffonparliament/status/1755942437556466046?s=20&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [leaks of aadhaar data](https://x.com/iffonparliament/status/1755940560345411611?s=20&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in) in recent times, blocking of content on social media sites ([here](https://x.com/iffonparliament/status/1755571146617975089?s=20&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in), here), [regulation of pirated content](https://x.com/iffonparliament/status/1754840962717671557?s=20&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in), status and mechanisms under the [broadcasting services (regulation) bill, 2023](https://x.com/iffonparliament/status/1755569289547919802?s=20&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in), cybercrimes and fraud ([here](https://x.com/iffonparliament/status/1755486608965456282?s=20&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [here](https://x.com/iffonparliament/status/1755481557010157760?s=20&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in)), building capacity and [upskilling for digital public infrastructure](https://x.com/iffonparliament/status/1754837957712728416?s=20&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in) roll-out, and the impact of [ai on the labour market](https://x.com/iffonparliament/status/1754829447620899055?s=20&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

## conclusion

the  budget session gave us one notable high, which is a marked increase in  ministerial budgets, but other than that sustained trends from last year  – high projected estimates but underutilisation of funds. in light of  the increasing digitisation across sectors and the increasing demand for  improved digital literacy as well as access to digital services, we  hope that the fund allocation in these concerned sectors continue to  witness a positive trend. in terms of productivity, though both houses  sat for an extra day, the discussions focused on political agenda items  since this would be the last parliamentary sitting for the 17th lok  sabha, and the last for the incumbent government before we break for  elections in april-may 2024. some pertinent questions were asked by  opposition members which touched upon digital rights and freedoms, but  we noted that the responses were not adequate, and data privacy concerns  for many issues remain unaddressed. we remain optimistic that the  upcoming union government will give these issues their deserved  attention and careful consideration.

i hope this gives people of banglore hope that they could also bring the change they want to see, the facilities they deserve and are not shy of asking for it. think of it as a return for the taxes that you pay. i hope the next time you see a potholes or a broken sidewalk, you will write an email instead of cursing the govt. i believe if everyone gives atleast one try, does one email, they can rid of garbage, potholes, drainage issues plaguing our cities. 

here is what you need to do and it will take just 5 mins and can be done from the comfort of your home. you just need to send an email. that's it. you don't even need to use your own email, you can complain anonymously as well. just create a dummy email and mention any random name at the from part of the email as yours if you want to stay anonymous.

1. go to chatgpt and ask it to write an email complaining about road conditions from point a to point b and ask the govt to fix it. mention it is causing difficulties for thousands of people living in the area. 
2. copy paste the genarated email and send it to cm.kar@nic.in 
3. just wait and watch the work getting done.

you probably won't get a reply back from the cmo email but if you complain using their helpline no., they will create a ticket and keep in touch with you and take confirmation if the work is done or not. so go anyway you see fit.

u/st_broseph i have been following your commendable work in this sub and i have been a great admirer of your work. you have been one of the reasons i took initiative in my own state to bring change wherever possible, from my end to make a better place for everyone. i hope you and your team can use this and add this tool in your belt to make a better banglore and spread the word among others so more people know and use it."

reddit,2024-02-14 01:21:46,"people who live in pgs how do you manage to not go insane? been living an a pg for almost 6 months and still not able to settle in. there was no options available due to increase in rental prices and demand.

below are some of the problems that i notice in my pg and need your opinion/solution to those:

- sometimes the drinking water does not feel hygienic. the plastic 20l bottles are in a very bad condition.

- idiots blasting music throughout the night. won't stop until it's 4am (how do they manage to do their jobs when they are not asleep till 4am?)

- shared washing machines that are mostly occupied/not working.

- food is quality is a little below average.

for people earning less, is it even worth it to stay in such conditions?

all this is so depressing that i just want to give up on this and run away to hometown even if it costs me my job."

reddit,2024-02-15 14:50:01,"to the re guy. 14th feb, 8 30pm, near taverkere road.
i was commuting via bike and here comes the re guy with really  bright led fog lamp shining like a sun, from opposite side.

there was heavy traffic and all were basically crawling so i got chance to ask this guy that why he needs those lights inside such small street, in a city. he can use his bike's headlamp which is more than enough.

however this creature with last working brain cell had audacity to ask ""what's your problem."" in the most arrogant tone.
now,  i too sometimes forget to switch off high intensity fog lamps, but if someone is pointing it out and instead of switching it off, if you are arguing, shows you don't know jack about bikes, about it's accessories that where to use what. you simply got few bucks in your pocket, like a child you put the brightest light you could afford and now you think you are utilising it by always keeping it on.(probably because with your 400cc, you never went beyond nandi hill on bike in your lifetime)

such people ruin image of whole riding community which is already having a bad repo. common sense is very rare.

edit:
i am. not talking about re ""bike"" specifically but simply referring that guy as ""re guy"".

all bikes are beautiful(even those which have been contaminated by specific kind of people).
all bikes have their own beauty and quirks (like our best friend). 
it's not the bike's fault that sometimes dimwits are riding them.

cheers."
reddit,2024-02-15 19:28:55,"samyukta kisan morcha and central trade unions call for nationwide rural shutdown and industrial/sectoral strike on february 16 
**samyukta kisan morcha and central trade unions call for nationwide rural shutdown and industrial/sectoral strike on february 16.** the bandh/strike is against the anti-farmer anti-worker policies of the modi government.

the bandh/strike will see the participation of students, youth, women, lawyers, professionals, small traders, vehicle operators, journalists, artists, authors, and social and people's movements etc. the call has been endorsed by various women organisations, youth organizations, etc.

**modi government's policies has pushed the farmers and labourers into a terrible tragedy.** rising unemployment, falling income and price rise has wreaked havoc on the workers. public sector units are being privatized. the government, which came to power with the promise of minimum support price and doubling the income of farmers, has betrayed the farmers. agricultural income has declined, and farmers are falling in debt and dying by suicide.

**unemployment has become a national crisis.** the modi government, which came to power with the promise of two crore jobs, has betrayed the youth. permanent jobs are being privatized and contractualized. regular employment is shrinking, while wages are declining in real terms. in 2019, the unemployment rate reached its highest level in 45 years. today, the youth unemployment rate stands at 40%. more than 24 lakh sanctioned government posts are lying vacant, while the government is asking the youth to sell pakoras. through agnipath scheme, the government has pushed the national security and the future of the youth into a crisis.

**economic inequality is at its peak.** the poor and middle class are facing the brunt of inflation, while the government is distributing lakhs of crores of loan waivers and tax cuts to the crony capitalists. in the last three years, when the nation was reeling under covid pandemic and economic downturn, the number of billionaires in india increased from 102 to 169. allegations of corruption and corporate fraud have been covered up, and those raising questions have been silenced. at the same time, domestic savings has fallen to the lowest level in five decades. social security and senior citizen's concessions are being taken away. the price of essential household items, including oil and gas, has risen sharply. meanwhile, hunger and malnutrition has pushed the country to 111th place out of 125 countries in the global hunger index, with three-quarters of the population unable to afford a balanced-diet.

it is worth remembering, that it was the railway strike of 1974 for an 8-hour working day, which shook the indira gandhi government. today, the modi government and corporations are trying to exploit the workers, and increase work hour, instead of reducing it. they rule over the people using a communal agenda.

the bandh/strike will raise the issue of livelihood of farmers and workers. **farmers-workers unity will break the corporate-communal nexus.**"

reddit,2024-02-18 19:02:48,"is powercut normal in bangalore? hi,

i work remotely for an it firm, and yesterday i conducted around 7 interviews over video conference for positions in bangalore.

out of these 7 candidates, i faced connectivity issues with at least 5 of them. i was informed that there was a power cut, causing the router to reboot.

my question is, even though bangalore is an it hub, is power outage quite common in bangalore?"

reddit,2024-02-20 15:19:35,"sony india is the worst. sony india has the worst service and most rude service reps. they treat their customers like shit and don't give a warranty on 3 months old product. i bought 1000xm5 headphones recently. they worked fine for the initial two months but after that, the product started showing signs of defects (touch panel working abruptly - noise cancellation acting weird). and last week its battery also started acting strangely (going from 100% to 1% in a few seconds each time after switching them on) - this is when i decided to contact sony india support.

they gave the same rote learned troubleshooting steps that i already followed from sony's site, reddit, and youtube. and after a day of this strange behavior - they went dead - without any usage and even after a full charge.

now, the only thing i could do was to go to a sony service center. i searched for the closest one. the guy opened the earcups and showed me that there were droplets on the device - i said ""okay that's a product defect - that it's capturing so much moisture - because i already read about their non-water resistance when i was buying them - so i was pretty sure not to let any sweat (gym) or water near them ever. ""

the moment i said this the guy took the cushion inside and squeezed it and a few droplets came out of it - i said again - i am 100% sure that the device has captured moisture and a product defect and said and i am quoting their exact words translated in english - ""see, there is water inside your headphones and we are pretty sure sony headphones never capture moisture - so you're lying and you have poured water on them. this product is out of warranty now. so, we can't do anything for you.""

i was speechless after this and i got furious after listening to all the bullshit that came out of those guys mouths. i started defending my point by showing them reddit posts where people faced the same problem but got a replacement (but it was usa - not india). the main uncle there was clueless and said what's reddit - india uncles with no clue of the world and attitude higher than the burj khalifa. the service guys started making fun of my situation that they see people like me every day?? wtf is that supposed to mean????

now, they are asking me for 18,000 rupees if i want a replacement and 9-10,000 rupees if i want to repair them. this is so pathetic and sad. and they know i won't pay this much ever. this is so shitty behavior from their side.

i tried my best to not lose my cool - it hurts so bad right now because for me it was kind of an expensive purchase - i bought it to celebrate my new job offer and i wanted to finally buy something nice for myself with my own money for the first time in life and this is what i got.

never in my life, am i going to buy anything expensive for myself and nothing from sony especially. this was the first and worst consumer experience of my life.

to put things in perspective - i bought them with almost 2/3rd of my month's salary. so, i am still sad about it. sorry for this long rant and f\*uck sony.

now i just want to know from the people of r/india that is there a way to file a complaint against them or should i just lose hope and move on? someone else faced this same issue ever and got it resolved and if yes, then how did they resolve it?"
reddit,2024-02-20 20:46:59,"need serious help regarding business in india vs work abroad hey. i am 22 years old and i come from a middle class family, did my engineering in computer science from a tier 2 clg and got placed in a good mnc with a decent package. right from my fourth year of engineering i started planning how i need to lead my life going ahead and realised that i have a good potential to become an entrepreneur. i have been a dynamic individual, a hustler and someone driven by purpose. i don't know how to explain but i feel i have that ability to stay longer with the problems and make anything possible.

during my planning stage, one thing when i was zeroing down on entrepreneurship that was constantly bothering me was the 'quality of life' in india. i stay in bangalore and where do i start? right from the dusty air, lack of civic sense, pollution, lack of cleanliness, terrible traffic and it's basically adjustment in everything. you want to go out with your frnds, be ready to battle the maniacs in the traffic, wait everywhere and torture yourself in the potholes, thanks to the poor infrastructure.

i then started thinking if it's even worth it to start a business in india, like sure you can get rich and all that is there but what's the point when you don't have clean air to breathe, no peace of mind and you are always struggling for basic needs such as the above. basically compromising on the quality of life.

so i started questioning my decision and was thinking of an alternative where in i can take an l1 transfer to u.s.a. from my company by involving a lot more in other projects and living to the true motto of my life 'max out your potential, regardless of whatever you are doing'. but i am not able to come to terms with the fact that i won't be an entrepreneur when i had that capability and instead i'm choosing this path which definitely eliminates all the above problems, but still you know deep down i might question myself why i didn't go all in when i had tht capability.

how do i get out of this rut? pls give me your advice/feedback regarding this.

thanks a lot for your time :)"

reddit,2024-02-25 00:46:02,"perfect middle class welcome to summer as we are all getting ready for the upcoming summer, i found it funny how summer kinda reunited my family even though we live in the same house and see each other every damn day.

last summer was so hot that our family pitched in to finally buy an air conditioner which is fixed in my parents' room. so when it was getting too hot, all of us migrated into their room. and this includes me, my brother and our dog. so we have our parents on the bed, me and my brother on our own beds placed on the floor one horizontally and one vertically and our dog sleeping under parents' bed , having the room to its maximum occupancy.  and every night we go to sleep enjoying the cool breeze just praying to electricity board to please don't make power cuts. 

and in the afternoons we all automatically flock to the ac room. so we are seeing each other more than before since we don't spend times in our individual rooms anymore. we all just kept spending time in the room eating ice creams and drinking cool drinks. and it felt like a perfect dream

and then the electricity bill arrived at the month end with a huge shock. so now we are all in our own rooms sweating like a pig in this hot summer because our desi parents wont be letting us turn on the ac anytime soon"

reddit,2024-02-27 14:07:46,what can be the solution to the water problems the city is facing? most of us are already aware of the water crisis the city is seeing. things are worsening and people are just stuck suffering. what can the government or us people do to change things for immediate and long term results?
reddit,2024-02-27 16:27:23,"why do contractors, handymen, laborers, etc. show up with no tools? i am a foreigner who has lived india (mumbai) for several years now. i have wondered why professionals i hire, for example, from urban company show jobs show up with no tools? considering i am a big diy person and hobbyist, i have many tools to lend them so it never is a problem, but it makes me wonder what would happen should another one of their clients does not have tools.

for example: 

when we need a water pump fixed, they ask for pliers, a pipe wrench and geiser hoses. 

when we needed some underground pipes fixed, they needed a pick axes and a hoe (we have a small garden)

we had a bee hive removed from a tree and they needed a knife, a bucket, some newspaper and a lighter. 

we had some light fixtures repaired and they needed a plaster saw, spare wires and lightbulbs.

its not so annoying as it is just interesting and weird to me. it would be very strange in the us to show up at a home with nothing but yourself, lol. can they not afford some basic tools from local hardware shops or mr. diy? can anyone tell me why it is this way in india?

reddit,2024-02-28 07:36:40,"how can we help solve the water problems in bengaluru? it isn’t even summer yet, and parts of bengaluru are already facing water shortages and water cuts! for four years, the water situation has been getting worse, and i’m deeply concerned. with only 1,850 million litres per day (mld) available, bengaluru needs at least 1,680 mld more to meet its growing needs.

private water tankers are exploiting residents, charging exorbitant prices, especially as summer approaches. i myself used to live in an area with terrible water levels, and my building was highly dependant on water tankers. the prices rose constantly, and it felt highly exploitative. bwssb blames poor monsoons, but the real issue lies in neglecting policies on borewell digging and rainwater harvesting.

we need urgent action from authorities to prevent an extreme water crisis. we’re running a campaign to demand action from the bwssb and bbmp.

the location is somewhere between vidyaranyapura, yelahanka and ms palya, so it's not a rural section to begin with. the layout owner who sold these lands to the developers never paid the bescom electrification charges and it all fell on our head, the residents are still using temporary electricity provided for construction. so all the residents came together decided to force the developers who sold us the lands since they did not pay up too before selling it to us, they have to pay up the fees of rs. 60000 per building to the bescom, all the residents who bought these lands from the developers forced them to pay the sum for bescom, the problem comes when these developers deny paying stating reasons like ""our site is smaller than the others/ i wont pay until i see some progress from others"" etc. the electricity charges are somewhere around rs. 10k where usually people pay around 2k since this is a temporary electricity only to be used for construction. the residents gathered almost half of the amount (somewhere around 60 lakhs) and paid them to bescom as an initial amount to at least begin the wiring or at least provide street lighting (mind you the place has snakes too since previously it was a mini garden like), the bescom se who is supposed to come for inspection is not at all moving from his seat even after paying up so much money (we residents sense that there is the local mla who's also involved in this matter, his story comes up in later stages). after so much pushing and pulling, we were able to install one streetlight in the entire layout (32,000 sq mt of land).

coming to drainage system, the sanitation system for each building is relying on pits (its a 20 feet well where all the waste is collected and for every 15-20 days we have to pay the sanitation tankers to suck out the waste from the pit), pits are common for new layouts until proper sewage system is installed, the problem here is even the waste water which doesn't go into the pits has no proper path to join the main line, this is something the government and specifically the mla is to be involved and take proper action. so, around 100-150 residence went to the mr. s r vishwanth's office to ask for his help regarding a permanent drainage solution and proper tarmac road and straight away denied proposing any solution or action for the layout, he was not even ready to listen to our concerns, the main is reason here is that the layout owner who sold those lands had previously him (mr. s r vishwanath, mla) to build a temple and failed to keep up the promise, the mla demands that we bring him to the mla, but the layout owner is a very big shot that he never responds to any of our calls and knows from a mile distance if we try to get to his house for convo, i don't know how the mla thinks that a temple is more important than the people's health (our layout is home ground for mosquitoes) and he scares us telling he will demolish the buildings saying we have no rights to own lands there, mind you folks that we are having proper online registered document, khata certificate, paying our property taxes and even have bbmp approval too. the deputy cm of karnataka mr. dk shivakumar recently hosted a program where he visits certain areas and asks for concerns, the residents were scared to even visit him cause this is a bjp ruled area, that he might something unthinkable to the residents if we go to congress government for help. 

we are stuck in a proper deadlock kinda situation where bjp government (yelahanka has bjp mla) are not at all helping and too scared to approach the congress government fearing the mla might do something bad. if you have read until this point kindly, if anyone have any solution or even the faintest of solution, we beg for it. thanks"

reddit,2024-03-07 00:58:51,"twitter storm for bengaluru water crisis we all are aware of the ongoing water shortage crisis in bengaluru. this is something that we all seem to be concerned about.
it might be possible that this crisis hasn't reached your doorstep, but it might soon! not creating any panic-y situation, but for some people it's a huge problem.
water is probably the most basic need of any human being, irrespective of whether you're rich or poor.

this issue is already being reported by local media outlets and has been covered by a few national media houses, but hear me out: can we have a twitter storm for this? we need to trend it so that it becomes a national news even for an hour. i know the state govt has started acting upon it, setup war zones and all, but who knows what they're planning out and how long will it take them to bring things on track.

from small colonies to the high end societies, a lot of the fellow bengaluru-ians (sorry if i made a mistake here) are facing this crisis, and the prices of water tankers have shot up (not that they're the permanent solution).

we can decide time, day and the hashtag for it, preferably weekend as everybody is free then. can also, take help of st.broseph to spread this message and mobilise people.

i know people will come and argue, average social media soldier, what good will it bring etc etc. but if this news does make it to the national media outlets for even a few hours or a few headings, then the purpose would be served.
the purpose is to let the govt know that the public is angry, frustrated, infuriated and what not. to not forget we're: scared/anxious too.

p.s. - please don't come saying ""go back to whatever place you came from and complaint there"". i come from india so chill tf down.

p.p.s - feel free to criticize this post using rational arguments, would love to read counter-narratives."

reddit,2024-03-10 03:39:49,"suggestion: solve bengaluru water crisis by privatizing water supply and bswbb solve bengaluru water crisis by privatizing water supply and bswbb!


unpopular idea - government doesn't know how to fix water problems in city of bengaluru.

1. bengaluru is the tech hub of india and the city will grow evermore in the future. cities public infrastructure has not been able to keep up.

if public infrastructure is bad in bangalore the city will loose it's attractiveness as the indian it hub.

many indian cities like hyderabad, coimbatore, chennai have been competing to get these investments. bangalore must not loose this competitiveness.

2. government is extremely inefficient in managing any resource. bswbb has basically failed in it's duties.

just remember the days when all we had was ambassador cars, bsnl telecom and air india. how bad was services provided by them. these companies were extension of the government with monopoly status.

3. privatization made india what it is. we were a struggling country - after 1990s we had a massive economic boom thanks to privatization.

3. the indian growth story we know exists because of lpg reforms by pm mr. narasimha rao.

liberalisation, privatization and globalisation improved our country.

4. when government was monopoly every sector was performing badly - private competition made the country a lot better in every aspect.

5. across india power utilities have been privatized - e.g reliance and tata power is supplying electricity efficiently to whole of delhi. torrent power has been managing electricity supply to city of ahmedabad, gujarat.

poor will never suffer - delhi power is managed by private companies. but government regulates it and subsidises power for poor. infact for the poor, the most affordable power is available in delhi (it's free for some units!) despite being managed by private company.

5. sanitation is outsourced - entire chennai city waste is efficiently managed by a spanish company urbaser sumeet.

6. even metro rail has been successfully outsourced - hyderabad metro is operated by kelios a french company.

7. many cities like bangalore where the government struggled with providing water &amp; sanitation outsourced the same to private sector, which made the services so much.

8. nagpur, maharashtra had really terrible water supply system.

veolia a french company took over the nagpur cities water supply - waste has been reduced, water was made safe, water supply and infrastructure drastically improved.

private sector invests in the correct infrastructure, reduces wastes and leakages and manages the supply properly.

9. there are many such examples where privatization and outsourcing of water supply actually improved services.

10. government could explore privatizing water supply and making bswbb a regulator than a supplier or even dismantling the incapable water utility company.

bswbb has proven incompetence. there is no point in paying huge salaries to government bureaucrats just to see the tanker owners making all the money while bangalore eternally suffers.

if not full fledged privatization, a staged privatization with ppp model could work."

reddit,2024-03-10 10:55:41,"jinhe naaz hai hind par wo kahan hai? an important appeal friends, **today our nation stands at a crossroads.** unemployment, price rise, economic inequality, and corruption are at their peak. attacks on dalits, adivasis, minorities and women are on a rise. our nation is being thrown into the fire of communalism and hate for the political gains.

**unemployment has become a national calamity.** the modi government, which came to power with the promise of two crore jobs, has betrayed the youth. permanent jobs are being privatized and contractualized. regular employment is shrinking, while wages are declining in real terms. in 2019, the unemployment rate reached its highest level in 45 years. today, the youth unemployment in india stands at 40%, while more than 30 lakh sanctioned government posts are lying vacant. through the agnipath scheme, the government has compromised the national security and the future of the youth. youths who demand employment are being violently repressed.

**government has pushed the farmers and workers in a terrible tragedy.** rising unemployment, falling income and price rise has wreaked havoc on the workers. public sector units are being privatized. the government, which came to power with the promise of minimum support price and doubling the income of farmers, has betrayed the farmers. agricultural income has declined, and farmers are falling in debt and dying by suicide. in 2020, when the nation was under lockdown, the government passed the anti-farmer laws in a conspiracy with the capitalists. in a struggle against this, 750 farmers lost their lives. meanwhile, a violent persecution and propaganda against the farmers continues to this day.

**economic inequality is at its peak.** the poor and middle class are facing the brunt of inflation, while the government is distributing lakhs of crores of loan waivers and tax cuts to the crony capitalists. in the last three years, while the nation was reeling under covid pandemic and economic downturn, the number of billionaires in india increased from 102 to 169. allegations of corruption and corporate fraud have been covered up, and those raising questions have been silenced. at the same time, domestic savings have fallen to its lowest level in five decades. social security and senior citizen's concessions are being taken away. the price of essential household items, including oil and gas, have risen sharply. meanwhile, hunger and malnutrition has pushed the country to 111th place out of 125 countries in the global hunger index, with three-quarters of the population unable to afford a balanced-diet.

in the last 10 years, **there has been an unprecedented rise in hatred and violence** against dalits, tribals, minorities and women. the modi government has sheltered rapists in spite of widespread protests. bjp leaders have publicly made hate speeches and called for violence. bjp-led governments have encouraged, sponsored, and protected the rioters. our religious festivals have been taken over by a political mob.

affirmative action policies are being weakened. **dalits, backward classes, and women are being deprived of their constitutional right to social justice.** forest law has been amended to facilitate corporate takeover of forests and drive the adivasis off their lands. overriding environmental concerns and objections raised by environmentalists and scientists, the government has pursued disastrous projects which has caused irreparable damage to the environment and the human life.

the bjp government has launched an assault against universities and academic institutions. scientific and historical facts are being replaced with propaganda and falsehood. government has openly promoted unscientific and irrational ideas. **health and education budget have been slashed.**

**there has been an unprecedented assault on democracy and the constitution.** mainstream media has become the megaphone of the government. independent journalists are being persecuted. any kind of protest or dissent is crushed with force. fundamental rights are being trampled. institutions like cbi, ed, income tax have been turned into a political weapon. the autonomy of the judiciary and the election commission is under a threat. parliament has been turned into a rubber stamp of the executive. federalism is being weakened with interference and attacks against the state governments.

in 2016, the modi government announced demonetization of banknotes with a four-hour notice. more than 100 people died in this man-made disaster. everything, from small businesses to everyday life, was thrown into despair. during the covid pandemic, without any regard for the common people, the government imposed nationwide lockdown at a four-hour notice. lakhs of workers lost their livelihood and crores of people had to face starvation. migrant workers had to walk thousands of kilometres on foot. **47 lakh people died of covid due to the government's indifference.** lakhs of people died without oxygen and hospital beds. due to a lack of space in crematoriums, rivers began overflowing with dead bodies.

generating 2 crore employment opportunities every year, making india a $5 trillion economy by 2024, building 100 smart cities by 2023, doubling the farmer's income by 2022, creating 10 crore new jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2022, bringing back the black money in 100 days, **every promise turned out to be a jumla.** meanwhile, bjp received secret donations of over ₹6,500 crore through electoral bonds. manipur is in a state of civil war. china has occupied thousands of square kilometres of ladakh, and built roads and villages within the indian border in arunachal pradesh.

to hide these failures, the modi government is using religion as its refuge. festivals and faith are being politicized. the public is being misled by spending crores of rupees on publicity. the reality of hunger, poverty, inflation, and unemployment is being hidden behind the curtain with an endless propaganda of ’acche din’ and ’amrit kaal’. **instead of guaranteeing fair price to the farmers, employment to youth, security to women, social justice to backward classes, education, health, and prosperity to the citizens, and unity and brotherhood for the nation, the ruling party is talking about “modi ki guarantee”.** at the same time, efforts are being made to amend the constitution and replace the democratic republic with an authoritarian state. a concerted attack on the values of our freedom struggle is underway.

friends, **today our country is facing an unprecedented crisis.** the freedom, achieved through countless sacrifices and a long struggle, whose values are enshrined in our constitution, is under a threat. the nation envisioned by mahatma gandhi, maulana azad, babasaheb ambedkar, jawaharlal nehru, sardar patel, netaji subhash chandra bose, shaheed bhagat singh, is under a planned assault.

the 2024 lok sabha election is the most important election in our nation's history. it is not merely an election between two coalitions. it is an election for our nation's destiny, for the values of our freedom struggle, for the survival of our democratic republic, for a new struggle and nation building. 2024 lok sabha elections is a “do or die” moment for our country. **it is our historic responsibility to reject the anti-people politics of bjp and ensure a crushing defeat of the modi government in the 2024 lok sabha elections.** let us, we, the people of india, unite in this historic struggle and defeat the anti-people modi government."

reddit,2024-03-11 16:00:56,"bangalore’s water woes are to remain until water literacy increases - though the kaveri water should be sufficient for bengaluru’s water problems, pumping it up has an economic cost. in the long run, people relying solely on it will have to pay the market cost (which is multiple times higher than now). 
- protecting the city’s lakes and filling them with rainwater harvesting and tertiary treated waste water is the only way out. these help fill up the ground water levels and keeps the problem of shortage at bay.
- competitive drilling of borewells is an “everyone loses in the long run” situation. 
- additionally, people need to be conscious of their housing colonies having waste water treatment plants and rainwater harvesting facilities. don’t buy (or even rent) into places that don’t have these facilities. 
- bengaluru's expansion is unstoppable. let's hope that it happens in a more structured and planned manner. we must hold local bodies accountable. bbmp elections haven’t happened for the last 4 years (they were scheduled in 2020). they’ll probably happen after the lok sabha elections in may 2024. hold them to account if you want to do something.

 i'm from odisha. people from municipality came to my street to enlarge the already existing drainage. they dug up the road and broke off the concrete between my home gate and the road to do their works. in the process, they broke pipe supplying water and we're not getting water from motor now. 

first of all, they dug up the whole street but didn't give any prior notice to us regarding it as it impacted our daily lifes about getting vehicles out and in and in general passage. secondly they did this and they didn't inform me about it. i got to know about it in the morning and this arrogant bastard is asking me to get it fixed within evening. now i can't get hold of any plumber. he says if i don't fix it now, they're gonna finish the drainage and then it'll be a very long process to get it done.

they created this problem and then giving me deadlines to fix it. i don't know if i can get any plumber within time but i want to complain about him though. please let me know how i can go about it. i want him to pay for his arrogance.

my neighbour had the same problem and suggests to go about it smoothly. to pay for whatever expenses. why should we compromise and incur expenses for these arrogant bastards mistakes? any inputs will be welcome.

reddit,2024-03-12 19:54:02,"my lasik experience in lvpei hyderabad, ama! # motivation

i needed to get spectacles for the first time when i was around 10 years old. my mother tells me she suspected i needed them when i was going too close to the tv to read the cricket score. i’m not sure how i managed in school because i needed glasses of -1.5d in both eyes.

that was the start of a snowball. my eyesight quickly worsened to -2.75d, -3.5d, and so on that i eventually had glasses of power -5.5d and -6.5d by the time i was 18. i couldn’t see anything clearly beyond a feet or two from my eyes.

fast forward to today, and i have been wearing spectacles for more than 18 years. i realised this when the doctor asked why i wanted to get lasik done, and i didn’t remember a time i did not wear glasses. i don’t know of a time where i could just wake up and not have a mini panic attack if i didn’t find my glasses by my side. because if they weren’t within a feet of me, i might as well give up hopes of finding it. i was that blind.

but back to my point. my daughter had recently started to pull my glasses when i picked her up, and it was an existential threat. so i thought, screw it. let’s get it done.

# the consultation

i had my first consultation around the first week of february. i got in at 12:45 pm and the waiting room was crowded. it took about an hour for them to call me in.

the first test was the basic read-the-letters test (hey, i’m not a medical sciences guy. work with me here). they checked if my vision was steady over the last couple of years and cleared me.

the next test was a tough one. let me preface this by saying my eyes tear up quickly. no, not in a emotional-movie-tear-jerker kind, more like a literal-eyes-tear-up kind. i can’t keep my eyes open for more than a couple of seconds. i blink a lot. so when the doctor asked me to keep them open for at least 10 seconds, i had a nice inner chuckle. good luck with that.

basically what they do is they ask you to keep your eyes open for about 10 seconds while they use this machine which evaluates the structure of your cornea. there’s a laser which you see, and you need to keep looking at it for 10 seconds. let’s just leave it at the fact that a test which was supposed to take 30 seconds took 10 minutes for me. i think my eyes used up all the water in my body by then, so i could keep them open just long enough.

my final consultation was with the surgeon. he checked the reports and confirmed my eyes were good candidates for the surgery. he told me there were three types of surgery i could choose - prk, where they remove the outer layer of your eye and then do the correction, lasik, where they make a flap of the outer layer and then operate, and smile, where they make a tiny hole and then operate.

he said while smile is the least invasive and has the fastest recovery time, lasik would be a slightly better option because of my high power. i went along with his suggestion.

# the surgery

i took a week off in the first week of march to recover, and scheduled the surgery for 2nd of march.

the nurse took me to a waiting area where they put a couple of types of drops in my eyes. it pricked a little, but was manageable. after a few minutes, they took me in and asked me to lie on this stretcher-type thing in between two machines.

the first machine was supposed to make the flap cut for the surgery. the clamped my eyes to keep them open (thank god) and then latched in this cylindrical-thing to the machine. the doctor warned me it will hold my eye in place, so expect a bit of pressure. there was some pressure when they pushed it onto my right eye, but it felt fine. i was asked to look at a bright green light, and after a couple of seconds, it was done. i couldn’t see anything from that eye. i think my left eye didn’t have enough anaesthesia, so i could feel the pressure a bit more. i had to breathe hard to keep my composure and not screw anything up. then i was blind in both eyes.

the nurse swivelled me right under the second machine. the doctor ran a piece of cloth over my right eye to open the flap, and i could see a hazy green light. he asked me to look at it for a few seconds while the machine whirred, and then ran the cloth again to close the flap. the same procedure for my left eye, but i felt the cloth a bit more because of the reduced anaesthetic effect. but it was fine.

once that was done, i was asked to get up, and i could see! i could make out stuff much farther than before, but it was still hazy. the doctor checked my eyes with a machine to see if all was good, and let me go.

he asked me to have any water fall into my eyes, so no head bath or face wash. no touching eyes or rubbing for a week. i needed to stay in a dim-lit room and avoid intense exercise. no screens or reading. he asked me to come back a week later for a follow-up. the nurse handed me black glasses, a prescription of four eye drops to be used every 3-4 hours, and i could go home.

# post-op

i could see surprisingly well for that first half-hour. i guess it was the anaesthesia because after that my eyes hurt like hell. it was as if i took a rose branch with extra thorns, put it on my eyes, and shut my eyelids over it. i could barely keep my eyes from watering. i think i used up a batch of dry wipes that day. i mostly slept on the first day, only waking up to struggle and open my eyes for the drops.

the next morning the pain was lesser, and i could keep my eyes open for a few minutes or so without them hurting from dryness. i could see much clearer, and that was so exciting! the surgery went well.

the next few days were much better and the pain went away. i could keep my eyes open for most of the day after using the drops regularly. it was tiring, but i could manage. it was a bit boring though, with my wife occupied with my kid and me not able to read or use my phone. i stuck to podcasts on spotify using the echo.

# after the follow-up

the follow-up consultation went well. i could read all the letters in the read-the-letters test, so i guess i have 20/20 vision now! i was asked to continue with a couple of the drops, and i could start working. i checked online and they recommend not to do strenuous exercise because it might put pressure on the eyes and sweat might get into the eyes. so i'm avoiding that for now. i still can't wash my face or my hair, and it's very itchy now with the summer sweat. i'm itching (pun intended) to get to the weekend so that i can shower in peace.

so that's where i am right now. ama!"

reddit,2024-03-14 16:21:40,"frustrating issue at pvr cinemas bangalore two weeks back, my friends and i decided to watch dune in imax at pvr vega city, bannerghetta road.

we booked 5 tickets for the 6th row. attaching screenshots.

the pvr app gave me the 3rd row (c) instead of the 6th row (f).

when we went to the cinemas to our surprise the entire cinema was full but we were confused why we were given cheaper seats in the third row.

we couldn’t see anything properly and our neck was hurting. we couldn’t change seats as all seats were taken.

during the interval, we asked the staff about it and they promised that they’ll resolve the issue post the showing.

after the movie, they told they will resolve the issue and reply back to us.

i’ve sent mails to which they have denied receiving any.

they keep saying they will resolve the problem but they don’t. and just keep extending the whole thing.

luckily, i had taken a screenshot beforehand and noticed that it was an error on the app.

even with all the evidence, it is clear that we haven’t been offered the value for what we paid for.

we wouldn’t have gone for the movie in the first place if we knew we were getting 3rd row seats.

the manager at vega city pvr is so rude and doesn’t offer us any answers or resolutions other than 200 rs popcorn.

we’ve been cheated here. what can we do here?

please help.

thanks"

reddit,2024-03-16 17:37:31,"got harassed by an ola auto driver hello fellow bangaloreans,

i wanted to share a horrid experience i had last night with a gunda auto wala(vehicle number-ka02 ac4309).

had booked an ola auto from hsr to whitefield at a certain price however upon arrival, the driver refused to accept my ride at that amount.
i cancelled and tried looking for other options. however, he kept standing next to me and was continuously trying to instigate me to fight him.i kept my cool and continued looking for other options. finally, i was able to book a rapido bike. to my horror, he warned me that he would beat the rapido driver and me.

since it was late in the night plus the crowd was dispersing, i started walking towards my nearest road junction i.e. bipin rawat chowk in hsr. he kept on following me all this time.

when my rapido arrived, this gunda removed the key from the rapido driver’s bike and started fighting with him.

this gunda called other gunda rickshaw walas and circled us. all this time, we were trying to get help from blr police force but the amount of back and forth we had to do just to register our problem was tiring and scary.

we held our ground and the police arrived after 15 minutes.we were taken to the hsr police station where they made us sit for 3 hours just to get our complaint registered.

that gunda driver had called his higher ups to make me take my case back but me and that rapido driver we didn’t budge.

the sub-inspector finally registered a formal case and gave a copy of my complaint.
he has called all of us today in the evening to bring this to his senior’s attention and provide a solution.
though i have made the decision of not rolling back my complaint, i am a bit scared for myself and my family members here.

these local goons have their own circle and may try to harm me and my family.
we travel quite frequently using all these apps and might come across their allies.
how to travel safely post all this?"

as with everywhere else, the water problem has hit hard. we have never had to buy tanker water and halve relied on borewells and cauvery.

now it's at almost 15 tankers a day. 

the association did not bother to notify residents on the number of tankers coming in and the bills have been piling up. 

we suddenly get a notice that each flat, irrespective of number of occupants or size of the flat, will have to shell out approx 3k a month. 

it's an old apartment so it seems they can't do invididual metres. how are other apartment complexes dividing water bills?"

reddit,2024-03-18 17:25:00,"economic shock therapy for bangalore water crisis  solve bengaluru water crisis by privatizing water supply and bswbb!


unpopular idea - government doesn't know how to fix water problems in city of bengaluru.

1. bengaluru is the tech hub of india and the city will grow evermore in the future. cities public infrastructure has not been able to keep up.

if public infrastructure is bad in bangalore the city will loose it's attractiveness as the indian it hub.

many indian cities like hyderabad, coimbatore, chennai have been competing to get these investments. bangalore must not loose this competitiveness.

2. government is extremely inefficient in managing any resource. bswbb has basically failed in it's duties.

just remember the days when all we had was ambassador cars, bsnl telecom and air india. how bad was services provided by them. these companies were extension of the government with monopoly status.

3. privatization made india what it is. we were a struggling country - after 1990s we had a massive economic boom thanks to privatization.

3. the indian growth story we know exists because of lpg reforms by pm mr. narasimha rao.

liberalisation, privatization and globalisation improved our country.

4. when government was monopoly every sector was performing badly - private competition made the country a lot better in every aspect.

5. across india power utilities have been privatized - e.g reliance and tata power is supplying electricity efficiently to whole of delhi. torrent power has been managing electricity supply to city of ahmedabad, gujarat.

poor will never suffer - delhi power is managed by private companies. but government regulates it and subsidises power for poor. infact for the poor, the most affordable power is available in delhi (it's free for some units!) despite being managed by private company.

5. sanitation is outsourced - entire chennai city waste is efficiently managed by a spanish company urbaser sumeet.

6. even metro rail has been successfully outsourced - hyderabad metro is operated by kelios a french company.

7. many cities like bangalore where the government struggled with providing water &amp; sanitation outsourced the same to private sector, which made the services so much.

8. nagpur, maharashtra had really terrible water supply system.

veolia a french company took over the nagpur cities water supply - waste has been reduced, water was made safe, water supply and infrastructure drastically improved.

private sector invests in the correct infrastructure, reduces wastes and leakages and manages the supply properly.

9. there are many such examples where privatization and outsourcing of water supply actually improved services.

10. government could explore privatizing water supply and making bswbb a regulator than a supplier or even dismantling the incapable water utility company.

bswbb has proven incompetence. there is no point in paying huge salaries to government bureaucrats just to see the tanker owners making all the money while bangalore eternally suffers.

if not full fledged privatization, a staged privatization with ppp model could work."
reddit,2024-03-18 17:52:52,"terrible experience at sbi so here's the entertaining story of my adventure at sbi. i knew their service is shit, but i was determined to go to the bank to do this: close my account. i had an old bank account at sbi from my college time and i wanted to officially close it because i wasn't using it. i have moved back to my hometown after graduating. i knew there would be some home branch drama involved so i prepared myself for it.

i went to the local branch and gave them my story. as i braced for forms to be filled out, the lady (who looked like a classic sbi aunty btw) told me to send an email to the home branch! i was pleasantly surprised! closing bank account can be done with email!? much wow. unfortunately she did give me a form and asked me to fill it, scan it and send it. fair enough. looks like it's just one form. basic details had to be filled out. went home, filled it, scanned it, and sent it. done and dusted. i wait for a week and send a reminder and ask them to respond.

no response. much wow. 

i knew sbi has a directory where they can call other branches and shit. so i went back to the local branch, went to the same lady. the wise old goldfish on her table told me that she forgets everything so i had to tell her the whole story all over again. so i tell her, emphasizing that she was the one who asked me to send the email. i tell her there has been no response over a month. she looks up her directory and gives me the phone number of the branch manager of that home branch. i can call and get shit done? much wow. 

i go home and call the number. he tells me he hasn't seen the mail and asks me to send me the account number and stuff on whatsapp. i send it over. and wait for some more weeks. i call him up again, and he says he can't do it. umm wtf? he says he'll transfer the account to the local branch so i can get it closed at the local branch. he asks me for ifsc. sbi addresses are not really descriptive so i couldn't figure out the ifsc online. looks like there's another trip to the lady that remembers everything.

i go to the branch and she isn't there. expecting her to be at lunch, i ask her colleagues. they say she's on leave. much wow. i caught hold of someone else and told them the story and they gave me ifsc. yay! yay?

i call you the home branch manager again and give him the ifsc thinking it'll take another month or so to get transferred, but voila! it's transferred immediately. transferring the account was faster than writing deep learning models in rust.

anyhoo, i go to the branch thinking it'll be my last visit. meet the lady. this time i just start narrating the story from the top lol without expecting her to remember anything. she listens without getting pissed, thankfully, and then i get to the bit where i transferred the account to this branch. so local branch is home branch yay! she asks me why. i say that branch manager refused to close it. and she erupts. she starts hounding me and asking me why i couldn't close it, like it was somehow my fault. i had to remind her that i'm not an employee at sbi (but a certain being i'm talking to might be powerful enough to solve the mystery of why the branch manager refused. alas, the being was unaware of their prowess) and that i was merely the peasant who held an account at sbi. she's then appears confused. i was worried i might have to tell my story all over again (the goldfish told me to be patient). 

then there is some back and forth where i emphasize that i simply want the account closed. she discusses this with her colleague and tells me that i need to do re-kyc. umm what's that? another form? yes another form. ok, is this the last mile? hopefully. i agree to do re-kyc. i need to produce some documents and it'll be done. i can then close the account. 

but hold on lol. she tells me that i need to wait 3 months before i can close the account. umm why? it's because re-kyc is done. so i gotta fill out this re-kyc first and then wait 3 months. 

yeah? fuck that. i took my money out and let the account rot. i was doing them a favour by telling them i want to close the account and the bitch acts like she's doing me a favour by letting me close the account. 

i went icici to close another account of mine. lady asks if i'm sure. i was prepared for more nonsense. i answered in the affirmative. she takes my card, cuts it, asks me to sign, asks for a bank account to transfer the proceeds to, and done! that was like 5 min. seriously fuck sbi."

unfortunately, by this time, the return window on amazon had closed. this is when the real drama starts.
i have called their customer care atleast a zillion times.finally after 2 months of following up, it was told that during installation, the installer has to check tds and show it to us, the installer never did anything of the sorts.
apparently for bangalore water, just a uv filter doesn't work, water quality so bad you gotta go for an ro, at the cost of wasting outflow water.
since december, i have been following up on mails, wanted to create some sort of a record bank for building my case. it's hilarious the amount of times i have gotten a response saying our ""quick response"" team is looking into this matter and will get back to you soon. it's been bloody 5 months now! they don't have a hq/corporate office in blr where i can go complain,

reddit,2024-03-20 11:57:18,"water crisis, my 2 paisa everyone in karnataka, especially my fellow kannadigas: it's high time we take charge. 

our land, the very soil we walk on, is under threat. it's not just about the politics or the corporations anymore. 

it’s about our home getting torn apart by greed and neglect. 


and yes, this includes the so-called it revolution that’s eating into our resources like there's no tomorrow. 

we’re staring down the barrel of becoming a desert if we don’t act now.kannadigas, we’ve always been the backbone of this land. our spirit, our culture, and our resilience have seen us through tough times.

but this? this is our biggest test yet. it's on us to lead the charge, to show that our love for our land isn’t just talk. 
we’ve got to dig deep and fight back with everything we’ve got.

and to all the migrants who’ve made karnataka their home, remember, running away isn’t an option. 

this is your fight too. 
the problems of this city, they’re yours as much as they are ours. 

cribbing for a work-from-home solution and thinking of bailing on our city won’t cut it. 

you’re part of this community now, and we need you to stand with us, shoulder to shoulder.

we can’t wait for those in power to wake up and smell the coffee. it’s clear they won’t. 

so it’s down to us, the people who love this land, whether by birth or by choice. we need to come together, not just as kannadigas or migrants, but as residents of karnataka, united in our effort to save our home.we’re more than capable.

we’re the ones who tackle the toughest coding problems and innovate day in and day out. if we can do that, we can surely find a way to safeguard our resources, clean up our act, and secure a future for the next generations.it’s time, folks.

 time to channel that frustration, that anger, into action. let’s not be the generation that watched karnataka fade into a desert. let’s be the ones who stood up, fought back, and reclaimed our land. together, we can make a difference. let’s get to work

any suggestions and potential solutions are invited. 
we already established corporate and govt are useless. 

edit 1: i do have a long term planning process but i would be needing help from the community.
i will be in touch with all thanks for supporting me. will get started from tonight."

reddit,2024-03-20 22:27:38,"why government isn’t forcing corporates for temporary wfh during these water crisis? so today my company announced that everyone has to shift to bangalore within next 2 months for wfo.

the office is in orr near marathalli and we are a total of 200 people. 
the first question that came to my mind was don’t these irrational people know about the water crisis? and why isn’t the government forcing them to continue wfh??

i have lived in bangalore for 8 months in my previous job and i completely relate to the problems that the city is facing. that’s why i didn’t want to come and then these people are forcing us now 🤦🏻‍♂️"

reddit,2024-03-22 15:39:32,"my suggestion to fix water problem lately, i've been seeing posts on water crisis asking for suggestions and solutions. i've some background in utilities management but not an expert. instead of posting as comment, i thought i better post this.

fact: bengaluru is lucky in the sense that it receives enough rainfall to supply 70% of its water demand yearly. so, the solution is fairly simple: aggressive rain water harvesting (rwh). i know this is already mandatory for big  societies to implement rain water harvesting but to what extent and capacity it's done, i'm not sure. so if you are in one, please check.

we have lost many lakes in last decade to development, but we can control the damage by building thousands ""micro-lakes"" in every society. this can be done by every society and we don't have to wait for government to fix and revive the lakes for us.

to demonstrate the feasibility, here's an example for a society 1000 apartment, 10 acres. 80% open space, far of \~ 3.5. 

catchment area of society: 45000 m2.

yearly rainwater harvested: \~41000 cubic meter. (900 mm rainfall)

the water required for dry season 3 months: (1000 x 165) x 90 = 14500 cubic meter.

max sump tank volume required: \~ 50 x 30 x 10 m. cost of building including labor: 5-7 cr. this can be below the lowest parking level, away from the building foundation. this is almost 3 olympic sized swimming pools stacked. this will be the micro-lake for the society.

during wet seasons, divert sump overflow to recharge the borewells.  the key is to not let water run-off outside the society. it will be wasted in severs.

cost per apartment: 50-70k  which is less than 1-2 months of the rent and can be offset by reduced water bill in 3-4 years.

following decisions can be taken by rwa's:

1. install water meters even for internal use to discourage water wastage. 

2. install dual drains for clear water runoff and soapy water run-off. the treatment and reuse of clear water is very easy and requires very less energy.

3. aggressively reuse water. the water treatment plants should be maintained well.

4. don't shut swimming pools during dry season, instead maintain the filteration system well. the water replacement is not needed for a long time. during summers, people can use swimming pool and then have bath using bucket at home and they won't crib about water rationing. everyone happy. 

the above things can be done by a society without any help from government. the societies should act like model village panchayats and they have the advantage that they can fund themselves for these kind of things. they can become examples which other rwa's can follow. the added benefits will be lesser flooding in the city and availability of soft and clean water for the residents. very less dependence on tankers which is a waste of energy also. government can give a token subsidy to earn some browny points and take credit for this if they want.

what you can do:

if you are a 

potential buyer: ask for rwh system availability and capacity for the flat you are buying.

owner: push your rwa to make this happen. it will increase your property value and reduce your maintenance bill.

tenant: ask your owner the same thing. don't prefer societies which rely heavily on tankers.

&amp;#x200b;

assumptions made: 67 lpd per capita of water consumption.  national rural average demand is 55lpd and urban is 125lpd, but this deficit can be offset by recycling water.

average number of people in an apartment: 3

 please correct me if am wrong in some calculations by a big margin and suggest other things.

tldr: aggressive and effective rainwater harvesting is enough for this city because we receive good rainfall. every society can become 70% self sufficient in terms of water supply. it can be done because it's in our hands and we don't need to wait for the government. eventually water table will increase and sustain, rest 20-30% of city's demand can be comfortably fulfilled by cauvery.

&amp;#x200b;"
reddit,2024-03-23 01:23:00,"post covid bangalore feels so different the costs are high..its hot..dust everywhere..metro construction blocking half of the roads.. don't get cabs. bike taxis are a faster option but then the driver may get beaten by autowalas. 

i get why the new people complain also being part of the problem(including me). i just wish they could see what bangalore used to be but not possible now i guess. 

local people used to be a lot friendlier then. i was blessed to have met so many local people when i used to work in malleswaram for 1.5 years, they helped me a lot. always grateful. it feels so different now"

reddit,2024-03-24 10:29:21,"harassed and threatened by society committe so this happened couple of days ago.
our society has been facing water shortage problem for the past few days and our society committe is not being transparent about it. they post notice on mygate that water will be pumped at 8 am but then pumps it at 7 am (which ends by 8 am ) without informing on mygate. furious with this my flatmates post on mygate asking for transparency from the society committe.

the committe members then calls me and my flatmate downstairs and starts harassing us. they threaten to kick us out and crack our heads open. their point of view is that since we didn't sign the rent agreement with them, they are not responsible to inform us of anything and we should be asking this from our owners. 

the point where things got heated up just seems so stupid and absurd to me. we were telling them how they should inform us if water is being pumped before the mentioned time, then suddenly one of them starts mimicking my friend and then all of them starts shouting on us. we left when they started shouting on us.

do i have any options or actions i can take against them? (at that time i felt there's no point in engaging with them since the way they acted was purely childish and stupid. but now kinda feel cowardly for not standing up to them then. i still know directly engaging with them would be a waste of time)"

reddit,2024-04-01 08:32:26,"buying all that gold is going to make india insanely rich!  the king and his gold

in his very first post on the kitco forum, october 5, 1997, another wrote ""gold and oil can never flow in the same direction"". this was a major theme in his writings. to understand another is to understand what is going on with the gold market now. and in that spirit i have written a short story that will hopefully help you understand this first important message from another:

many decades ago the saudi king realized his barren kingdom was sitting on a gold mine. only it wasn't gold, it was oil. from his high perch as king, he was able to see the wide and very long view of the world, way off into the future. he saw a future filled with many riches, but he also knew that those oil reserves under foot were only finite cavities of value. as a king, he knew the workings of money and fiat currencies. he knew that the western world needed his oil treasure, but he didn't want to exchange it for only paper. he wanted to turn his virtual ""gold mine"" into an actual pile of gold.

back then, the paper which paid for the oil was redeemable for gold directly from the us treasury. so there was no problem. he would take the paper and then turn it in for gold. later, after much inflation, the us treasury defaulted on the promise of gold. chaos ensued for almost 10 years. the price of both oil and gold skyrocketed and there were long lines at the gas pumps. for this kingdom was only willing to trade it's finite supply of oil for an equally finite store of value, gold. and without a secured source of gold at a stable price, the oil wells just didn't have the incentive to run at peak production.

then in the early 1980's, the markets were brought back under control. a secret deal was cut between the king and a few very high, and very powerful leaders in the west. these leaders probably included central bank chairmen and top level leaders in the us and the uk. the western world was on it's way to world domination, both financially and militarily, but to maintain this power it needed cheap oil. the kingdom was a good way through it's reserves of oil, and to part with this valuable commodity, the king needed the promise of an equally scarce store of value, gold. so the deal was that oil would be shipped to the west in exchange for dollars and gold. the dollar price of oil would be kept low as long as the much more valuable gold could be had for those same low costs. the central bank's involved in the deal guaranteed this to the king by backing up the deal with their own vast stores of golden bars.

but these top bankers, like the king himself, were not as dumb as they may seem. in fact, they were the best and the brightest, for they knew that the true value of gold was probably somewhere around $50,000 per ounce in today's dollars. and that was the value of oil to the king as well. his oil reserves might only last his kingdom a mere century, but if he traded it for gold, not dollars, he would enjoy the wealth of his treasure for 1,000 years or more.

the central banks that backed this deal with their own gold never intended to give the king any of their precious treasure. they knew they had a way around that. by using the open markets which traded paper contracts for gold, they could keep the price of gold down to $300 per ounce and the public would be none the wiser. then, the king with his $30 per barrel of oil could buy future gold delivery straight out of the mines in backroom deals for a premium of perhaps 100% (which is a guess). so for 20 years, vast amounts of gold flowed from the west to the middle east for maybe $600 per ounce (twice the spot price on comex at the time), and those sales were hidden from the price discovery exchanges so as not to affect the price, and the oil flowed to the west freely, at the seemingly cheap price of $30 per barrel. but in reality, the king was getting one ounce of gold for 20 barrels of oil, and if gold is really worth $50,000 an ounce, that's a price of $2,500 a barrel.

so who is paying that price? in a way, all of us are. the mines are making a profit for what they pull out of the ground. they are getting twice the cost of mining. that's a good profit. but the gold in the ground under us is flowing east, while the oil in the ground in the kingdom is flowing west. so who is getting the better part of this deal? i say the king is.

sure, we have seen unprecedented prosperity for 30 years now. but that is about to end. on the other hand, the king has seen 50 years of amazing prosperity and is looking forward to another 950 years of extreme prosperity. you see, once the oil runs out, the kingdom does not become poor. in fact, that is when the party really begins! they have sold to the west 30 or 40 years of prosperity in exchange for a thousand years of unimaginable wealth.

then, around 1997, some big money in the far east became aware of this bargain on gold. but they couldn't get in on the back room deals that traded large amounts of physical without affecting the price. so they had to accumulate physical on the open market which started to drive the price up. this started the 10 year rise in the price of gold..... and oil! for now that the king has to pay more for his gold, we have to pay more for his oil.

and somewhere along the way, too much physical gold was heading east, both to the desert and to the great wall, and the mines could not cover it. this threatened a default in the paper gold price discovery markets used by the central banks to protect their own gold reserves. so they were faced with the option of either watching the whole monetary system crash, or parting with some of their own gold. they finally had to ship some of their precious treasure to the king. after that near disaster, they fought the markets even harder, with larger and larger short positions. but now, at this very time, they (the central bank's) have maybe half the gold they once had, and they have probably the largest short positions ever too. so they are standing right on the edge of a cliff, holding the end of a rope that's trying to pull them over.

it won't take much for this deal to fall apart. and when it does, we'll see the price of gold go up to probably $5,000 an ounce and then all trading will stop. no market will exist for gold at it's true value. for those that have all the gold in their possession are only buying, not selling. oil will skyrocket too... if it flows west at all. this is coming, and soon. buy gold. hold gold. it only has to meet it's true price once in a lifetime and that will be more than worth the wait. i believe this is not a once in a lifetime opportunity right now, but possibly a once in the history of the world opportunity. silver, platinum, commodities... they may all do well. but nothing will come close to the true value of gold. $50,000 an ounce may even be low. – fofoa

another (thoughts!): the inside story on the gold-for-oil deal that could rock the world's financial centers:

reddit,2024-04-05 14:04:53,"warning. do not opt for airfiber connection from reliance jio  there are enough and more posts on reddit already talking about the atrocious customer experience with reliance jio airfiber. sharing my experience here as a warning for people to stay away from reliance jio as an internet connection provider.

i applied for a new internet connection two months back. yes, you read that right. i live in bengaluru (a globally recognised metro city) and i have been waiting for an internet connection for two months. while applying for the connection, reliance jio asked for a booking amount of rs 1000. 

this was followed by a two month period where i sent them 10-15 emails following up on the connection request to get the engineer to visit my place. 

their app and website looks flashy, but once you start using it, you realise that the relationship between the frontend and the backend is nonexistent. i got multiple text updates on different days informing me that the engineer will visit my residence that day. naturally, no such person materialised. i asked them repeatedly on mail to refund the booking amount if they couldn’t provide the connection. no replies.

finally, someone called and when i started shouting, they asked for ‘one last chance’ and promised to send an engineer soon. 

the engineer finally arrived yesterday. and the imitation-apple white branded boxes he was carrying from jio seemed promising. 

he started the verification process for which i had to submit my aadhar, photograph and more. the registration itself took half an hour. then the person informed me they had no monthly plans available and i must pay in advance for 6 or 12 months. 

more fool me, i was so relieved that i was finally getting the connection that i paid it on the spot - rs 4241. 

then, he started trying to provide the connection. he brought out the largest router i have ever seen in my life (half a vertical playstation or the full-size expanded oxford dictionary) with its own power supply box. the router looked old and used even though it was wrapped in paper. 

then once he managed to get the connection from the roof, this power box refused to power up. the engineer guy tried different wires, then tried to cut the wire and fit it in, but the router wasn’t getting enough power supply. 

finally, they said the box on the roof was faulty. but i already have another connection from act that’s working perfectly fine that uses the same. after about two hours or so, i lost patience. we had not eaten and these guys were blocking the whole drawing room. the job usually takes about 10-15 minutes as act/ airtel people have done it before. i asked them to leave and take the router and everything else as they couldn’t get it to work. 

this morning, i got a call from customer service asking me if the installation was done. i told them it wasn’t. apparently, the engineer had marked it as activated. 

and surprise, surprise! they informed me i had a working connection and was using it! i had to explain to the customer care executive that i didn’t even have the router or the fiber wire at my place for the connection that i was apparently using. i told them i didn’t want the connection anymore after all the hassle and to please refund my money.

then i was transferred to another guy from the ‘activation team’ that flat out refused to refund the money. he kept saying, “if there’s an issue, we’ll sort it out”, even though their own engineers couldn’t sort it out for over two hours yesterday. 

i promised to take them to consumer court and the guy seemed completely unfazed. i understood that this was basically a pyramid scheme adjacent - they force people to buy their connection for 6 months or 12 months with no guarantee of service. 

i’m now poorer by rs 5000 and have not received anything in return. i think i would almost feel better if someone had stolen my purse at knife point. it would have been better than voluntarily buying any reliance product or service to make one of the richest men in the world richer.

feel free to share this post with anyone in your circle so they don’t fall for reliance’s enormous marketing and lose their hard-earned money."

reddit,2024-04-06 07:43:34,"does congress manifesto for 2024 delivers well on people's expectations or it's missing something? reading through congress manifesto feels like it covers most of the commonly talked about issues with  promises to deliver upon them like social equity, youth, women, farmer, worker, constitution, economy, federalism, national security and environment. there are promises of new laws, amendments, monitory benefits, job creation etc. overall many would relate to the issues identified. though how piece could be addressed with some details as many of these promises are projected as wishes and intentions (subjective opinion) which will raise genuine questions around viability. especially when some of these promises looks like huge financial undertaking on any govt's part.

there is a good amount of focus on bjp too, in fact almost every section starts with a run down on bjp. 

surprised to not find anything related to space tech. less to none about high tech, innovation, road safety,  assessment of representatives, accountability- though there is a mention of reprimanding them if they leave a party. just one line to strengthen a program on air pollution which is a huge problem now.

what are your thought? does it appeal to you or you find it missing some key elements?"

reddit,2024-04-08 09:09:17,"living with hot days so many posts about “unbearable heat” and frustration with sweating inspires me to write this. our city bengaluru is more forgiving than so many other cities which see temperatures rise to 50 too. i know that the existence of 50 doesn’t negate the pains of 35-38 but if people keep reacting to this in all the wrong ways, it will make the situation even worse. here are some pointers that can help for those who would care to use them. 

1. temperature of any day is a range. blr is seeing 21-35 nowadays. it becomes 35 for a short time in the whole 24 hrs. please get the max number out of your heads. that’s a psych aspect - the more your mind thinks it’s hot, the more your body reacts to the notional heat. 

2. work with nature. if it is being harsh with 35, it is also being kind with 21. close your doors and windows around 10 am every day. and then open all doors and windows around 5 pm and allow the cross ventilation to start. do close the mosquito net on the windows and the doors around 6-6:30 to keep mosquitoes and bugs out. the cross ventilation should continue. by 10-11 pm, the house would have actually cooled down including the walls. 

3. mop your floors and sit on the floor or non-cushioned furniture like mesh chairs or jute chairs which help wick off body heat instead of heavily cushioned office chairs, sofas and mattresses or plastic chairs which trap body heat. 

4. diet. please eat and drink things suitable for summers. indian curd, preferably without sugar, cucumbers, kakdi, drink lots of water. a lot of people crib about having to go to the loo often but you do loose a lot of unwanted body heat that way. so drink water - lemon water, jeera water, cucumber water, watermelon - not sugary drinks, or juices. when our body processes sugar, it generates heat. stop eating biriyani and other masala foods for this entire period. stick to simple veggies and use rice during the day instead of wheat. 

5. attire. wear cotton- thin porous cotton. even in t-shirts, there are thin ones and thick ones, choose with intent. don’t let words like dry fit and athleisure lure you - cotton is our skin’s only friend when it comes to heat. 

6. shower/bathe early and late. the purpose of bathing is to cool your body. if you can, then do let the body cool properly and not just do quick showers. change the shower heads to spray instead to let out the same amount of water over longer period so the running water has time to collect your body heat.

7. plants. they regulate temperatures like a boss. have some(a lot) in your rooms. this however is a long term project- one needs to have enough of them to actually make a difference. this heat is good for so many of them - expect a brilliant mango harvest. and seeing happy plants makes your heart happy pushing out some of the misery and frustration with the heat. 

8. if you buy an ac, be aware that it will only compound the problem. all the posts about heat and the strongest recommendations to buy ac could have salesmen behind them fanning the frenzy or just people who want quick and easy solutions and don’t care about what happens to their surroundings. 

9. our bodies know, trust and listen to your body. sweating is natural. even after all these, if you managed “sweating buckets” then just change your clothes - they really don’t have to remain on your body to make you feel sticky. if you go to office, carry a change of clothes - just the way you would to the gym - they don’t weigh much anyway. 

we have a small cooler and we have yet to take it out for the season. hubby will probably take it out this week. 😎 bengaluru sees summers in late march to april. may will bring the rains. i think we all are smart and wise enough to manage for this short time while our trees start their new cycle and some of them make mangoes 🥭 🥭 🥭 for us while others make veggies and lemons and watermelons for us only."
reddit,2024-04-08 09:12:46,"they are burning everything down... yesterday, i saw people burning a big area for building apartment/society. they burned trees and plants for more than 6 hours. instead of burning them, they could have moved the trees to another place. even in my smaller city(tier 3 city), they move trees carefully when they're building smart cities projects. why don't they do the same in bangalore? all this just to sell expensive apartments, even though it could have water/climate problems in the future. and they're not even planting new trees to make up for the ones they destroyed.

seeing trees burning for over 6 hours made me worry. i never used to think much about the weather or trees before. but now, with water and weather problems, i'm not sure where we're headed."

long story short, since childhood my life's meaning was to excell in academics getting 90 percent, making myself, my parents happy. and i did it till 12th boards. life was meaningful to me because i had a purpose, faith that my life has a meaning in grand sceme of universe. i mremeber, i was around 14, 9th grade when i started to question what is the point of life, if my parents and everyone including myself will die, it did not make any sense to me, i could not force myself to believe into something that i find it illogical, i avoided these thoughts making myself busy in study and talking to friends, 12th result was good,that year gave jee without any prep, got 95 percentile, thought to take a drop later, could not get tier 1 college, so i made another huge blunder of taking another drop. that existential dread came back, life was meaningless, jee and everything was meaningless, and i wanted to end my life, too coward to do it, so i kept reading some philosophical books on existential crisis nihilism rabithole, more than physics chemistry maths so i can find a meaning and sense why live this horrible life, came to a conclusion that, the only reason i find meaning in life is fulfilling my duty as a child, making my parents happy. my biggest motivation to not end is them, but even if i work hard, because of my 2 drop year, i wont get any good placement. 

i made them dissapointed even if they dont say it, i understand, it slowly kills me from inside , they are immensely supportive, dad(53) is an auto driver, drives 12 hours on a very bad road with potholes, he still never compromised on my education and my life. i wasted their support, money. i made their life worst too. 

how to make them happy, i dont want my dad to work like this. i dont know if i will get any good placement to support my family. i can work hard coding is my interest, but my 2 drop years will always be questioned, i cant tell my interviewer that i was depressed. very confused and hopeless. and i want to change things. but how?"

long story short, since childhood my life's meaning was to excell in academics getting 90 percent, making myself, my parents happy. and i did it till 12th boards. life was meaningful to me because i had a purpose, faith that my life has a meaning in grand sceme of universe. i mremeber, i was around 14, 9th grade when i started to question what is the point of life, if my parents and everyone including myself will die, it did not make any sense to me, i could not force myself to believe into something that i find it illogical, i avoided these thoughts making myself busy in study and talking to friends, 12th result was good,that year gave jee without any prep, got 95 percentile, thought to take a drop later, could not get tier 1 college, so i made another huge blunder of taking another drop. that existential dread came back, life was meaningless, jee and everything was meaningless, and i wanted to end my life, too coward to do it, so i kept reading some philosophical books on existential crisis nihilism rabithole, more than physics chemistry maths so i can find a meaning and sense why live this horrible life, came to a conclusion that, the only reason i find meaning in life is fulfilling my duty as a child, making my parents happy. my biggest motivation to not end is them, but even if i work hard, because of my 2 drop year, i wont get any good placement. 

i made them dissapointed even if they dont say it, i understand, it slowly kills me from inside , they are immensely supportive, dad(53) is an auto driver, drives 12 hours on a very bad road with potholes, he still never compromised on my education and my life. i wasted their support, money. i made their life worst too. 

how to make them happy, i dont want my dad to work like this. i dont know if i will get any good placement to support my family. i can work hard coding is my interest, but my 2 drop years will always be questioned, i cant tell my interviewer that i was depressed. very confused and hopeless. and i want to change things. but how?"

reddit,2024-04-17 12:26:51,"whose manifesto do you like better? i have created a word doc that has topic wise side by side comparison. all the points are as they appear in the manifestos. (i haven't changed anything) **here is the document :** [**manifesto topic wise comparison**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yzua5pxtgjg_mxjxslh4zfica6ohy5ho/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=112103166487411801226&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)

**about the document**

*read time of the entire document : 15 minutes*

*the document has exact words from both the manifestos without change, and i have included all the points in both the manifestos and classified it topic wise manually. no chatgpt or any other ai tools used so that they don't miss any points and hallucinate etc etc.*

*some points can belong to multiple topics, i have added most points only once in the document.*

*if you think some points can be better classified into other sections, please suggest/comment in the document or here.*

*it would be great if any of you can convert this into an interactive website (like streamlit using python) for greater accessibility and good.*

*please form your opinions only after going through the entire document/manifestos, there are a lot of things proposed by both sides that are astonishing and are less talked about in the social media/media space*

**general first thoughts about both the manifestos:**

1. the first thing that caught my attention was that, congress' manifesto has neutral english language and neutral section pictures. bjps manifesto is so much filled with hindi words in english that is so hard to comprehend and you know has name and pictures of modi everywhere.
2. congress' manifesto is overall well balanced and less vague than bjp and gives my heart a positive hope about our shared future. finally it feels like all the things we rant about on reddit regarding democracy and centralization of power has been addressed. however their manifesto on travel infrastructure (like ports/airports/roads) is short and general. bjps manifesto is filled majorly only related to infrastructure points that are vague.. in most points they talk about what they have done in the past and how they will continue the same. 
3. congress emphasises a lot on the personal human aspect of governance like freedoms and liberties.

**freebies or welfare** whatever you call it **:** 

1. **the myth that congress is a freebie government and something that would bankrupt us is overblown**. 
2. **what if i told you bjp also doles out equal freebies if not more?**   
i was shocked to know that bjp in last 10 years has given out 34 lakh crore alone in direct cash transfers to beneficiaries. they have mentioned this in the initial pages if you want to verify.
3. what congress is probably going to do is unbundle various schemes through which the present govt does cash transfers and then re-bundle them into one scheme ""mahalakshmi"" and give out 1 lakh per poor women family.
4. congress is most likely to do this transfers only after socio-economic survey and my guess is that it would atleast take a year or two along with census. they would try to limit the outflow as much as possible. 
5. lastly since the amount is fixed at 1l a year , as economy grows this outflow will remain same while collections increase.

**democracy, constitutional bodies and judiciary:** 

1. **this section is what gives me a positive hope.**
2.  **division of supreme court into 1. constitutional court 2. court of appeal** 
   1. i think this is to avoid judges to sit on cases of constitutional validity/importance for years like the electoral bonds case since 2019 and the money bill to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny
3. congress in depth talks about decentralization of power after their experience of having brutally suffered in the last 10 years and the abuse of power. they now know what to fix to strengthen this democracy.
   1. **from centre to states** : 
      1. they said they would transfer some subjects from concurrent list to state list. basically making the centre focus more on things like defense (national security), foreign affairs and give more autonomy to states and better tax sharing between centre/states
   2. **remember delhi govt and constant interference from lg (lt. governor)?** : here is what they say
      1.  we will amend the government of national capital territory of delhi act, 1991 and declare that the lieutenant governor shall act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers of nct, delhi on all matters, including services, except on matters concerning the three reserved subjects. 
   3.  **more powers to local city and rural bodies (:** 
      1. taking into account rapid urbanisation, they say that they will amend the laws to grant more executive, financial and administrative powers to the directly-elected mayor/chairperson for effective governance in urban local bodies and gram sabhas/panchayats *( a. the panchayats (extension to scheduled areas) act, 1996. (b.) the forest rights act, 2006. (c.) the land acquisition act, 2013).* i think this has to do something with taking over of villagers/tribal land for commercial exploitation and deforestation..
      2. improved governance of mayors to improve urban governance, the mayor/chairperson will be directly elected for a fixed term of 5 years along with a council. executive, financial and administrative powers will be conferred upon the mayor/chairperson. the administration will be accountable to the mayor/chairperson and the council. 
      3. i think this has something to do with local cities not holding mayoral elections regularly like bmc/bbmp
      4. a portion of gst revenues will be allocated to panchayats and municipalities 
   4. **more powers to sport bodies :** they also talk about decentralization of power to sport bodies acc to recommendations of the justice lodha committee and olympic charter etc to prevent and solve the whole mess around wrestlers.
   5.  **institutionalize the process of appointing the chief of defence staff  to ensure transparency and military consensus**
   6. **prevention of horse trading , automatic disqualification:**  to amend the tenth schedule of the constitution and make defection  an auto disqualification of the membership in the assembly or parliament.
   7. **law to tally 100% of evm with vvpat**
   8. **we promise to strengthen the autonomy of the election commission of india (vague)**
   9. **no to one nation one election (a big big thing for democracy)** 
   10. **to improve transparency in media and give more freedoms to journalists**
      1. **repeal broadcasting services (regulation) bill, 2023**
      2. review and delete controversial clauses that give  unbridled powers of censorship to the government from digital personal data protection act, 2023; press and registration of periodicals act, 2023, etc.)
      3.  amend the press council of india act, 1978 to strengthen the system of self regulation, protect journalistic freedoms, uphold editorial independence and guard against government interference against arbitrary search and seizures...
   11. **pledge to ensure that both houses of parliament will convene for 100 days each year, reviving and upholding the esteemed traditions of parliament.** 
   12. **additionally, one day per week will be dedicated to discussing the agenda proposed by opposition benches in each house.** 
   13. **we promise to end the arbitrary and indiscriminate suspension of the internet**
   14. **review the telecommunications act, 2023 and remove the provisions that restrict freedom of speech and expression and that violate the right to privacy.** we promise to review all laws that interfere with the right to privacy and make suitable amendments to various laws to uphold the right to privacy
   15.we promise to enact a law on bail that will incorporate the principle that ‘bail is the rule, jail is the exception’ in all criminal laws.
   16. **review of all laws passed without discussion and scrutiny by nda**
      1. all anti-people laws passed by the bjp/nda without proper parliamentary scrutiny and debate, especially those relating to workers, farmers, criminal justice, environment &amp; forests and digital data protection, will be thoroughly reviewed and changed. 

rest of the things i will talk in future posts..

whats your take and thoughts???"

reddit,2024-04-18 18:00:42,"toxic work place hello, 


i was working in a school which had toxic environment 

the worktime will fluctuate as per the whims and fancies of the management.  it is already 9 hours and at times it goes up to 10-11 hours. 

sundays also will be having work. and tenth class students didn't get a day off after oct in name of board exam. even a single day. 
teachers won't get compensation. compensatory off will be cancelled if we have late markings. 

casual leaves will be cancelled if the month has more holidays. 


harassment based on attire- you will be judged. sometimes they have problem with jeans, other day it will be leggings. all these are not applicable to themselves. 

the princi yells at all the teachers, staff , parents and children. 


she asks house keeping staff to carry bench n desk from third to ground floor and back for exams, photo session or any events. these women are old and they carry all these here are there. they are not given any off even on spl occasions. 

washrooms doesn't have water or proper facilities. nd management is least bothered. 


more than 15 teachers left during an academic year due to this torture. some of their salary was withheld saying that they left abruptly. she was having medical conditions. when someone leaves they are not bothered to recruit anyone, the burden naturally falls on existing teachers and they suffer. 



housekeeping staff were also told to pay for gift which i came to know later. they all paid and got ger gift. i felt bad bcs their wages are peanuts. 

when she arrives she wants some housekeeping staff to carry her bag to her chamber. evening any taff carries her bags back to her vehicle. sadly she has slave master mentality towards workers. 

they do not provide joining letter to anyone. i still have lot more to add. 



i went through a lot of mental harassments and yellings... etc my mental health went down hills.

it’s been 5 months now and not even a single document (khata/electricity bill/tax receipt) is transferred to my name. 
reason: their legal partner forgot to apply for the transfer. but the nobroker customer service agent kept saying it’s govt delay. their legal partner called me in feb and said they missed applying for it and they later applied after 2 months of me purchasing the plan. now the nobroker customer support doesn’t even respond to my calls or mails. please do not opt for their services."

reddit,2024-04-20 14:10:52,"do you think we would ever see a citizenry that will question the politically powerful? irrespective of who is in power, do you think citizens of this country will ever start holding the powerful accountable? and not just trust them on face value?

in my limited understanding, in a democracy, the governments should be answerable (and, in fact, fear) the citizenry. i understand that any powerful political force that has deep pockets would eventually move to establish a superiority by curbing oppositions and curtailing rights bit by bit. it does not take much to realize how deep a cut a ruthless political propaganda can make on the society; so much so that if one would ever try to question the powerful, their own neighbours would be up in arms against them.
but does this all mean that the citizens take such a political force for granted? does it mean the citizenry bendsover to become mere subjects?

i do not want to get into discussions of why people did not raise their voices for issues from the days when they were not politically literate. like most sane people, i also would prefer questioning what is happening today to the people who are accountable today. you have a problem, question about it today, and then tomorrow and then the day after, untill it is addressed, irrespective of who is in power. trust me, you'll be hated by not just the accountable people for asking them questions but sometimes also by the people you considered your own. 

we aren't time travellers to go back in time to question dead people. people who were alive back then should have questioned the then governments. had they quetioned back then, had they held the power accountable back then, we would have much better living conditions today. by not questioning today, we are setting stage for a similar apathetic future for ourselves and our young ones.

the people in power should not be believed when they proclaim they're mere servants. instead they should be questioned and held accountable. know that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. no one, absolutely no one in this world is incorruptiple, despite how much simple, hermitic and profound they make themselves seem. so before you put people on the pedestal, treat them as answerable servants and not deities you would have to worship for the next 5 years."
reddit,2024-04-20 17:13:38,"indians need to hold their government facilities accountable. recently i've seen a lot of posts about india and indians defending the country's poor hygiene, lack proper roads, etc, why are you guys so proud?

there's literally trash and potholes on every road, over 85% of indians are still in poverty(earn below 600 per day). our politicians, media and every aspect of government organisation is corrupt to the core. power cuts are a common occurrence at a sight of rain clouds, they don't even wait for it to rain. constant power cuts due to poor maintenance and 20+ year old power lines. water scarcity in metro cities as well as villages. we spent billions for a statue just for tourism near it to be nothing great. government spends over 5-8 crores per 1km for roads and highways yet they peel off in the first week of rain. 

all of these issues are only from my privileged life. i'm probably in the top 10% of wealth in the country. now imagine the issues faced by common man in the 85% area.

when will we as a country start to hold our government representatives accountable? when will we stand up for our human rights? or will common indians always be a fodder for the capitalist elite and government to take advantage of until we die?"

reddit,2024-04-21 17:23:43,"water purifier companies robbing you in daylight. i wanted to shed light upon how expensive water purifiers are to maintain. if you get clean water &amp; don't have to pay for the maintenance, well lucky you. i've read about other companies as well &amp; these prices are equivalent to daylight robbery.

i purchased a livpure water purifier back in 2023 for about 7.2k with all discounts &amp; sale going on. while purchasing this, i checked online, livpure filter prices were around 2k or so which i thought was expensive but affordable. all ran well all year, other than livpure's sales calls to buy the amc. 

cut to first week of april 2024, i decided to get my filters changed because according to me i had used it for 6-7 months now. livpure technician came home, changed filters, membrane etc. &amp; tore me a receipt which in turn split my a** into 7 dragonballs. a bill of rs. 5095. for context, i stay alone &amp; i was out of station for about 7-8 months in 2023 so, this seemed like a rip-off. i got it done anyway. cut to 2 days post service, the purifier was continuously throwing out water. to a point that the water tank in my house was getting emptied constantly. i waited for some time thinking it'd be due to the new filter but then raised another complaint. technician visits, says some pump has gone bad which is rs. 360 + rs. 400 service charge. with this bill, my total for this water purifier service was going to be rs. 5855. i said i don't want to get this part replaced, so the technician repaired it &amp; took the service charge only. still a total of rs. 5455 &amp; probably more to uncover which i hope doesn't happen.

in a gist the calculation is,

you pay, rs. 30 per day to own a water purifier like livpure. on top, your machine can go faulty anytime &amp; the parts are expensive so all the best with that as well. 

or you buy a 2 year amc that costs about 10k.

and the best part of all of this is, after creating a problem called expensive annual maintenance, these companies also have the audacity to sell subscription service where the benefit is that you don't have to service it. 💀💀

in a world where clean air, clean water, food &amp; shelter are the basic needs of life, almost all of them are getting more &amp; more unaffordable everyday. be it air purifiers for air quality, price of the daily groceries, real estate &amp; then this water purifier."

reddit,2024-04-22 15:59:26,"psychology pov: “so many people are already voting. i don’t think my vote will make a difference so i’m not voting” what happens when everyone thinks like this? original twitter thread at [https://twitter.com/anushkakumar\_02/status/1782322086020857948](https://twitter.com/anushkakumar_02/status/1782322086020857948) 

full post:  
if many people think “my vote doesn’t matter” and so don’t vote, it will likely have negative outcomes that don’t reflect the preferences of the majority.

voting is a situation in which our behavior is highly dependent on others’ behavior.

i noticed another similar situation happening in my colony but not in the context of voting.

our colony had just provided every flat with a free dustbin that was internally segregated into two compartments—green for wet waste and blue for dry waste.

i thought my mother would use it (instead of our regular non-segregated dustbin) because it’s easy to:

* decide if waste is dry or wet
* throw it in the relevant compartment

but we were still using the regular dustbin (without segregated compartments) and i was surprised.

when i asked my mother the reason for not using the new segregated dustbin, she told me that it was because no one else was using the new segregated dustbin.

(people in our colony kept dustbins outside houses every morning for the garbage collectors to empty our dustbins. and my mother didn’t see the segregated dustbin outside anyone else’s house.)

so when my mother told me the reason that we’re not doing it is because others aren’t doing it, i was again surprised (and disappointed). 

because, what if everyone is thinking that way—we aren’t doing it because others aren’t doing it.

“we aren’t using the segregated dustbins because no one else is using the segregated dustbins”

if everyone thinks that way, then no one will ever use those segregated dustbins. 

i asked her about what’s wrong with us being the first family to use that segregated dustbin.

i reasoned that maybe others will notice us using the segregated dustbin, and they’ll begin using the segregated dustbins too?

imagine how many kilograms of waste can be composted /recycled/reused instead of being thrown into landfills.

imagine the large-scale environmental impact all of this could have. and this could begin from one house taking the lead.

everyone’s seemingly “small” actions ➡️ huge impact.

you see how here, our behavior is highly dependent on others’ behavior (we aren’t doing it because others aren’t doing it) ?

in the dustbin incident, the behavioral phenomenon was social proof/conformity: when we’re unsure of what to do, we tend to do what the majority is doing.

in the voting situation, the phenomenon is diffusion of responsibility/bystander effect: there are so many people. someone else will do the responsible/right thing. my efforts don’t matter.

here’s an example to understand diffusion of responsibility/ bystander effect (and it’s potential large scale outcomes)

suppose there’s an accident on the road.

many people are driving past the victim just because “there are so many other people to help this injured person, why should i be responsible for helping them?”

i think of it as a fraction.

the numerator is 1 (for one responsibility, let’s say, to help the victim) and the denominator is the number of people people present (or let’s say, driving past).

* if there are 10 people driving past, each person feels 1/10 or 10% responsible to help.
* if there are 100,000 people driving past, each person feels 1/10,000 or .001% responsible to help.

more the number of people driving past the accident victim, more the diffusion of responsibility i.e. less responsible each person feels.

even if one person doesn’t give in to diffusion of responsibility and helps the victim, they could save a person’s life.

everyone’s seemingly “small” actions ➡️ huge impact.

apply the same to voting. it’s a phenomenon in which our behavior is highly dependent on others’ behavior.

it’s quite paradoxical because individual actions make up collective actions.

as i said earlier, if many people think “my vote doesn’t matter” and so don’t vote, it will likely have negative outcomes that don’t reflect the preferences of the majority. 

if everyone thinks that their contribution is “too small”, it’ll lead to a large-scale failure to act.

don’t give in to diffusion of responsibility.

everyone’s seemingly “small” actions ➡️ huge impact.

reddit,2024-04-23 13:40:17,"why are we so entitled and uncivil? - mega rant so just now, i am in my car at a signal waiting to make a legal u-turn. there are other cars and autos behind me waiting to do the same. there is a divider to my right next to me with tall shrubs planted. it’s one of those intersections where on green, the opposite traffic flows, and i have to make the u-turn when i see a break in the oncoming traffic which flows at quite a speed.  at appropriate time, i make the u-turn only to collide with a two-wheeler which is driving on the wrong side and that too almost hugging the divider on their side. no one’s hurt, nothing serious, a fender-bender. 

tamasha time. 

these two guys right away get down from their bike and start abusing me. i try to pull to the side so that we can resolve the matter and also the traffic behind me and the oncoming traffic can make way. they block me. so now my car is half-turned, sideways occupying more road than necessary. soon crowd gathers. there’s honking, cars, autos going around, chaos. the signal changes, so the traffic from the other side charges in, only to be stranded in the middle of the intersection.  even though i am shit scared for my life, i get down and consciously being polite, i ask them to move our vehicles to the side, but no go. i understand, by being aggressive to pre-empt me pointing out that they are literally on the wrong side of the road and that they’re at fault. don’t need to go into more details, as we have seen these incidences. a tall hefty shopkeeper, who must have witnessed the whole thing, comes to my rescue. he starts off with maa-behen gaalis to those guys, goes 2-inches close to their faces and i am thinking he is going to thrash them.  they back down and leave. 

what happened here? a law abiding citizen, following traffic rules came close to getting extorted for money or worse get beat up for absolutely no fault of theirs. i am not naive, i could understand them extorting money if i was at fault. what shook me up is them being riding illegally on the wrong side and still had the audacity and balls to publicly take an offensive stance. you need 8 pair of eyes to drive in india. because it is yours and yours alone responsibility to not only safeguard yourself and your vehicle but also save other people’s lives, their vehicles, their emotions, their pride, their misplaced self-importance and attitude.  
  
before anyone says “india is not for beginners”, i am born and brought up in mumbai. yes, i made a mistake of going abroad to study and work for a decade. and then made another mistake of coming back. i can honestly say, all the civic sense, common courtesy and collective responsibility (especially on the roads and public places) that i have learned, i have learned abroad. i should be punished for following that in my own country.  
  
after i migrated back, i would show indicator for every small turn. a childhood friend mocked me “oh you are so american now! nobody looks at indicator here!”, i told him, “i have learned few good things abroad and i will keep following them” i was laughed at. so we also have this mentality of not only will i not follow rules and regulations but also put others down who do follow.  
  
who taught everyone to drive in the middle of the road and then have this attitude of “you go to your left if you want to avoid collision. i will drive in the middle!” it would be funny if it was not dangerous. i call it raja complex. this is generational trauma of everyone wanting to be the raja and but remained praja.  


if i have a meeting at say 11:00 a.m., i will reach there by 10:55. of course nobody else is there on time.  and this happens every time. so much so that one time, the person setting up the meeting said that i reach there on time and have to wait, so he called everyone else half-an-hour early. so say 11 for me and 10:30 for everyone else. i reach there at 11 and still nobody is there. once they trudge in, they jokingly suggest that i am a lukkha and have nothing else to do so i am always on time. this is systemic folks. arriving late at the meeting is seen as a power play. i literally feel like crying while laughing. no you are not he powerful person here, you are just a vendor, and should be thanking me.  
  
during covid, children in our housing society would play in our open parking compound in the evenings.  my wife and i would go for mini strolls downstairs at times. and i see football getting bounced off cars, including ours. kids are putting badminton rackets, water-bottles on it, they are leaning on it. not just our car but 3-4 cars. so i request them to not use car as a table. i even lugged down a folding table for them to use but no, they kept at it. eventually and as expected, side mirror got damaged. so i complain to the chairman and secretary of the society. and because they have been living in the society for many years before us, they think they own the society and how can the kids not play in their society? okay, at least tell them not to damage other people’s property. no, no one else is complaining, why are you? blah blah. i gave up.  
  
this is not just about cars, recently did renovations of a flat and employed a contractor, got bedroom doors made through is carpenters amongst other things. one door is noticeably tedha. i can see it is leaning on one side, the contractor refuses to accept it. there are 10-12 workers in there, i ask them to tell me its not tedha, they all look at me like i am stupid, like they’ll go against the contractor who gets them work. so i ask them for a leveller. they bring this concoction of a thread and some water thing and says, the door frame is tedha. boss, you only made the door frame. oh shit, he realises, measures again and with straight face tells me the flooring is uneven. him and his workers sate at me straight face, like i am a ch\*\*ya. if i ask the builder, he will say the earth soil is tedha. this was one such instance amongst several for the whole flat. the guy never miscalculated or did anything except perfection as per him. never accepted any mistake (there were several glaring ones). it is draining, exhausting and one gives up after a while.

last week went to buy some chocobar at a local kirana store. his guy picked out the bars. i check them and almost all are broken inside. so i tell the owner that they should not accept such broken ones from their supplier. legit he takes a bar, over the plastic he brings the two broken pieces inside and joins them, “keep it in the freezer for half an hour, it will become one piece” he tells me. but that’s not the point, i am paying you full price of a chocobar that is supposed to be a one single bar. i walked out.

and it is not just uneducated or illeterates, but also educated and well off people. few years back, we were taking a train back to mumbai from a small town in the north. since it was a last minute thing, my mil drove us to the station. we are at the ticket counter in men’s line, my wife is in women’s, whoever gets their first. my mil comes after parking the car, straight away jumps the women’s queue and buys the tickets in 3 minutes flat. my wife and i are embarrassed, my wife is scolding her mother. that is all well and good, but the astonishing thing was, nobody, not a single person objected. yes, i am sure some of it was because it was a woman, but none of the 10-12 women in the queue said anything. basically, when it comes to us individuals or our families, if needed we all will take advantage of others because “once in while it’s okay yaar!”

i was seeing off a friend. he got on the 2-wheeler, his 6-year old son on pillion. i was telling him, exit the gate, go left, make a u-turn and then go straight. well he saw there is another cut towards his direction, but for that he will have to go small distance on the wrong side (similar to two guys on the bike from the beginning). i told him there’s usually a policewala at the corner. he laughed it off saying, if he catches me, 100 rupees is all i need to get away. now, his 6-year old son has subconsciously learned that not only it is okay to break a rule, but if caught, it is okay to bribe as well. he went wrong side just to avoid going around a bit.

people cross streets like they are strolling in a park. they legit don't look sideways.  it is everyone else’s responsibility to make sure they are not harmed/ 

i know we all have all gone through struggles like these, but it’s been 11 years since coming back from abroad and in that period i find we are becoming worse. this post is not about how west is better than us etc. this is not political either. increasingly, there’s absolutely no accountability, no regard, or fear or respect for rules, regulations, laws. no fear of repercussions, it seems like there is bitterness in people that’s just wants to scam or punish others. i don’t know. it is sad actually because we will never change. 

now i understand why we can’t produce global products, why it is so dificult for indian companies to become big globally. it is exhausting to get anything done correctly.  

that’s it. end of the rant. thanks for reading.  

tldr: accident due to others driving wrong way. people cover up incompetency with attitude, uncivil behaviour in public places, entitled behaviour, ready fight always"

reddit,2024-04-26 11:05:06,"how much burning garbage is too much? a few of my neighbors burn garbage around my house. it's not regular. but its atleast once a week. i put it out the minute the smell it. i have told a few to not burn. a few don't pay attention to my request. i read that garbage smoke is carcenogenic and can cause growth and birth defects. now i am an 19 year old college student. i used to live in a pretty good class a officer housing with tons of greens so moving to this society for my college i am pretty damn sensitive to all this stuff as i am used to living in a much healthier and cleaner environment than most folks in india. i also understand that studies that point out the dangers of burning garbage have a huge sample size as in you would probably need to inhale metric tons of this shit to have an impact.

but you can't be too careful i guess. how much is too much when it comes to smelling burning garbage? my house is a rented house in a shitty desi style  architecture in chambal with little ventilation. i practically use my cooler as an bug exhaust fan."

reddit,2024-04-30 08:11:32,"adoption alert bangalore recently a community cat chhotu (mom) who was ferocious and territorial but loving to the feeder  died in generator room due to electric shock. the 4 beautiful kittens have been rescued from the janitor room after 4 days struggle.

vet checkup is already done. 

dewormed, de-flead, litter trained, healthy and extremely playful.

they seem to be better adjusted to human interaction now after recovering from their mother's death

the three tabbies are female (bella, ruby and stripey) and the fourth one (alpha) is probably mixed siamese and male.

preference is to get them adopted in pairs : bella &amp; stripey, ruby &amp; alpha. alpha would be given as a pair only as he is a scaredy kitten and would need his bonded sibling ruby with him to feel better. 


please come forward to adopt them.

dm me for more details.

reddit,2024-05-04 15:08:58,"why is no one talking about this? in amit shah's gandhinagar seat, 16 candidates have withdrawn from the election race. why would they do this if as they claim, their work has been so gooood? chandigarh to surat to indore and now this.

public doesn’t seem to care so neither do they :)

democracy and free and fair elections? anyone?

now some typical bjp bhakts will do whataboutery and say what about emergency, what about booth capturing in pre-2000 era etc etc 

amazing how people are willing to trade humanity, empathy and their freedoms/liberties/privacy, democracy, social harmony for infrastructure.

no whataboutism please, all these things (minus infra) were far better in were far better in upa era.

even if for a moment we give the benefit of doubt to those who support bjp and accept their argument or stance, **whats the guarantee that bjp would continue infrastructure push when they become authoritarian?**

and infra doesn’t mean only roads, airports, ports. it also means clean air, environment, accessible spaces, smart cities (remember?) , etc

and this infrastructure image that bjp has has its own fair share of corruption so bjp supporters cannot claim they are clean (all are equally dirty in corruption, none spared) , and has its own quality problems, toll prices problems, monopolisation problems. so the reason why bjp came to power in 2014 was riding the india against corruption movement.. now that differentiating factor of non corrupt vs corrupt has vanished.. whats left?  and something as recent as electoral bonds, washing machine to reinforce this point.

even if you assume both congress and bjp are equally corrupt and deliver equal economic performance, congress atleast has better social fabric and democratic values. see their manifesto if you haven’t. 

&gt;*i created a whole pdf document comparing both the manifestos topic wise in a side by side tabular manner so that it makes it easier and faster to make informed decisions for the benefit of all and it has the exact same words and lines from each manifestos and nothing is changed or deleted/missed.*

economy? most of the economic growth is because of the govt spending and we all see the joblessness and unemployment rates..if govt is really doing good then they should be talking about jobs and employment in the election rallies and propaganda…

but there are commendable positives like startups, digital economy

do you think if this govt had created enough jobs during its tenure, they wouldn’t have made a huge campaign and drumbeating about it? 

this govt celebrates even the smallest of things like the biggest of things …

what about religious hatred that is being spread and whats the point of all the wealth or infrastructure if you dont have social harmony in the country and have riots like scenario?

whats the point of all the development when you dont have basic freedoms to eat wear love marry according to your choice..

like many have pointed out, the trajectory this govt is on would end up being a banana republic like china with dystopian human rights and liberties minus the infrastructure that china enjoys. (*this is the best they can do at  their best, assuming no corruption, rapid industrialisation, infrastructure, which is unrealistic, so we would end up with worst human rights and mediocre infrastructure*) 

if democracy is intact and breathing incompetence and flaws of govt can be exposed and made accountable,
once you become authoritarian, what can anyone do even if you don’t do any infrastructure development? 

even if you ignore allllllll these things just answer this question: 

**if the modi govt is doing sooooo good (whatever this good means to you) then why do they need to demolish democracy?

wont they be re-elected anyways if they did such an amazing work that you some of you believe?   

rig elections in broad daylight, jail opponents, break parties, suppress freedom, suppress and control media, do all these nonsense religious hatred, pass bills without discussion debate, use money bills to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny, suspend opposition mps enmasse etc 

whats the need for all of this?"

reddit,2024-05-05 17:16:00,"beware of donation scams in bangalore! recently, my brother, who recently moved to bangalore for work, encountered a disturbing scam that i believe everyone in the city should be aware of. one evening, as he was leaving his office, he was approached by individuals claiming to collect donations for various causes, such as improving bangalore's infrastructure or reducing pollution through initiatives like introducing more electric buses.

being new to the city and encouraged by a colleague, my brother engaged with these individuals. they managed to convince him and his friend to make a donation, resulting in a payment of 800 rupees each. what's shocking is that the payment was made through their net banking, and it turned out to be an e-mandate lasting for the next 30 years!

this experience exposed a disturbing scam targeting unsuspecting individuals who want to contribute positively to bangalore's development. when i contacted customer care to rectify this, they directed me to visit the hdfc bank branch, where officials informed me that canceling the e-mandate would take about 7 days. what's more frustrating is that the e-mandate isn't even visible in the sihub of hdfc bank, where one typically sees listed e-mandates for services like hotstar or netflix.

this incident serves as a reminder to always be vigilant and cautious when approached for donations or charitable contributions, especially when dealing with online transactions and e-mandates. let's spread awareness to prevent others from falling victim to such scams in our community.

stay safe, bangalore!"
reddit,2024-05-05 21:11:39,"my ex, love of my life, filed false sexual harassment charges. i came out clean. what action can i take when nobody seems to care?
 people of bangalore, brace yourselves for millennial drama! tl;dr in the end

hello everyone! 4 years ago, my then live-in partner, filed a false sexual harassment case on me which made me run pillar to post in courts for all these years, only to see her not show up to the court at all. finally, after four proclamations and an nbw, she shows up only to turn hostile in the box and deny her complaint. my spirit crushed right there. here's how the story goes;

i am a native bangalorean. the two of us fell in love when i was 21 and she was 19. our relationship went on for two years before our parents found out. by then i had already materialised my brain-child of a start-up. so when confronted, my parents threatened to throw me out of the house if i chose her over them. me being the righteous kind, said it wasn't fair on her, and obliged. at a very young age, i learnt how it feels to be dejected by your own. to make matters worse, they even had a tiff with the girl's side over the same. succumbing to parental pressure, even the girl left her home (i wasn't notified, her eloping came out of the blue to me)

because i already had a business up and running, i accepted her decision but we chose to live separately. she assisted me with client communication while i closed the deals and worked on projects. a year down the line, we moved into a flat, started living-in together. that's when the problems arose. she often kept stirring up inconducive conversations about how my parents had behaved with hers and how they were disturbed   and all. i kept telling her that what was important was that i was with her, away from my parents. but it gradually became a huge concern and things only went downhill then on. while i had no qualms with her going to meet her people, she made sure that i didn't reconcile with mine. she would often resort to self-sabotaging, slicing up her arm and whatnot whenever we had an argument. while i spoke as a team, she always considered me as an opponent in an argument.

one unfortunate day, i came back home only to see her pull off a gone girl. poof! she was gone. what more, she had eloped with every single document that ever mattered to my existence. starting from my bank cards to company documents to personal documents to vehicle documents to even the house key! 

not only had i lost the one person who i fought the world for, i also had nothing to go on with. four days later i learnt from her friend that she had been suggesting my girl to leave me for over a year, because she thought i wasn't the right match! not only did she not return my stuff but also tried to get an equal share from my bank account because we were living-in. 

i was depressed, shut myself in, didn't even let my parents know, when all the while she had comfortably returned to her home. seeing my condition deteriorate, my friends themselves informed my parents and they were once again back in my life.

after failed pleas for a decent parting for over a month, i had to file a complaint in my local police station about my missing items. the cop was very kind to help me out with such a trivial matter. he fetched her location and sent me to retrieve my stuff only for me to realise that she had returned to her parents' native. i alone had to riskingly enter a village where i knew everybody would be hostile. it's a miracle i even made it out safe. the woman didn't budge. she kept saying everything was rightfully hers. had to return empty handed because dare i not confront a 'woman' amongst her own people. 

two days later, the cop stepped his foot down and asked her to come down to the station along with her family. once there, instead of responding to my complaint, she creates a hue and cry about how she's an equal shareholder and deserved to get half of my bank balance because we were in a live-in relationship. i held my ground but a few cop subordinates coerced me saying that i better give away the money otherwise she could very well press rape charges against me. i had no words. i was coerced into writing a cheque, only for me to realise that she along with her friend had forged up false documents to make the claim. 

me being the righteous kind, said it wasn't done, and blocked the cheque (mind you, i blocked the cheque while maintaining sufficient balance). 

a month later, she slammed me with a cheque bounce case, alleging that cheque bounced due to insufficient funds. i couldn't care less. 

i appeared before the court and pleaded not guilty, said i'd fight it out. 

her family and herself couldn't stand it at all. parallely, they had to account for a random guy showing up at their native and also about her disappearance for two years. us being from the same locality, they went around saying how i had married her and cheated on her, treated her the worst bla bla bla, and that they were gonna send me to prison. 

which they did, a month later. but never did they reveal to people on what charges and what case.

here's how the fir went: 

that she and i had met four years ago in some annual meet and that i had been persistently behind her since then, stalking her and forcing her to 'love me, love me'. and one fine day, i lost my shit, followed her, pulled her dupatta, outraged her modesty (a foolish attempt at bringing in ipc 354, 354a charges) and threatened her to love me or else i'd kill her entire family (ipc 506 😂ik). 

the joke of it all? i wasn't even in bangalore on the said day!!! 

here's a woman who in the beginning of the relationship had absolutely no hesitation to lie to me for sympathy points about how she was sexually abused and molested as a child!!! (women of reddit, please chime in as to whether anything can justify this!! i was too blind in love to overlook this, and had instead chosen to let go), and now she was lying through her teeth that i myself had tried to  harass her sexually.

because she was a woman and brought in some influence, the police not only registered the complaint but also filed the fir without any investigation. i was arrested in the night, wasn't told why, was kept in the cell overnight, was taken to the court next day. despite it being a non-bailable offence (14-day remand a mandate), the judge saw through the truth of the matter instantly but a.p had gone home by then, it was 5pm. unfortunately, i had to go to prison for one night (don't ask me how i came out sane. after what i saw inside, i doubt very few men can), was bailed out the next day. to my dismay, the police filed chargesheet with the only evidence in it being her statement along with her family's.

cut to four years later, after countless sessions with my lawyers and in court, my fighting spirit had worn off. but since truths were by my side, although delayed, justice arrived. in both cases. 

i had come out clean from both the false charges (the cheque bounce and the sexual harrasment). the orders in the first stated she had miserably failed to make her case and that she had produced questionable evidences. in the second, the orders stated that she denied me ever outraging her modesty and that the incident never happened. 

finally, after four years (covid to top it off, business had fallen faceflat), i walked out of the court, spirit battered and bruised, but soul at peace, at last. 

my battles are over, now is my time to salvage my life. there's absolutely no incentive for me to go back to the mess again. but me being the eccentric righteous kind, just can't get the matter out of my head. 

i cannot digest the fact that an individual can bring one's life to shambles with their malicious lies, all because they're from a particular gender/group. i'm not making this a man v/s woman issue. i'm making it a truth v/s lies issue. no lie should be able to reign supreme, no matter the difference is in gender, race, class, creed, age etc. 

i cannot stand the fact that a lie could be so loud and destructive whereas my truth when came out, came out in silence. the court acquittal orders were issued at around 3pm by a clerk in an empty court room, judge wasn't even around. atrocities of the lies were loud, but my truth was barely a whimper.

i've always believed that human suffering should amount to a difference in ways of the world. if one has suffered, he must strive to ensure someone else doesn't face the same fate. if suffering goes unquestioned, then really, what is the point of it all? of this society? 

with these thoughts in mind, i consulted my lawyers and i wanted to press more than civil defamation charges. i wanted to press criminal charges because it is a criminal offence to file false firs, commit fraud and present false witnesses. my acquittal orders are already foolproof evidence to all these crimes. 


yet, yet....i have zero support. parents brushed aside my rebuttal saying that i better not get into it again since she can come up with any cock-and-bull story. i can't even begin to explain to them how irrational their fear is. i didn't relent. said i would take action myself with or without their help. finally, they gave in, said that they'd press charges on my behalf as my parents and that i focus on my future.

believing them, i moved to a new city for work and resumed my life. now, suddenly, they're singing a different tune. that they're too old to be taking all this stress, that they tell it for my own food, and that i should let it go too.

i cannot even!!!!! now, i'm stuck in a different city, with all the trauma, and all alone! if i wanna go back and take up the matter myself, i'll jeopardize my work, and i can't trust my parents to ever stand for me. 

so here i am, desolated from my homeland, dejected by my own, and destroyed by the only person i ever chose to love the most. 

what respite do i have? what action can i take? i'm no johnny depp, why would the world care when my own parents didn't? how can i, being thousands of miles away, even start to take legal action over this? 

it's actually super easy and convenient for me to put it all behind, but i simply cannot. if my own well-to-do parents would rather disown me again than stand by me just because it's a woman on the other end, what hope does any average man in india have? what hope does truth have over lies?

i need help. so that with my voice, i can help to ensure no other soul succumbs to malice in this deceitful world. that one day, i can fearlessly call out my perpetrator and encourage others to do the same.

humans of reddit, i appeal to you. please help! 

tl;dr - i left my parents for my love. 
              my love left me for her parents.
              her parents abetted her in framing me with false charges. 
i came out clean.
now my parents will neither let me fight the lie nor will they help me fight the lie. 

and i cannot let my suffering go pointless, since things really need to change in this country. old outdated laws must have no place. no woman should have unquestioned power to indict a man where he has no say. help!"

cut to four years later, after countless sessions with my lawyers and in court, my fighting spirit had worn off. but since truths were by my side, although delayed, justice arrived. in both cases. 

i had come out clean from both the false charges (the cheque bounce and the sexual harrasment). the orders in the first stated she had miserably failed to make her case and that she had produced questionable evidences. in the second, the orders stated that she denied me ever outraging her modesty and that the incident never happened. 

finally, after four years (covid to top it off, business had fallen faceflat), i walked out of the court, spirit battered and bruised, but soul at peace, at last. 

my battles are over, now is my time to salvage my life. there's absolutely no incentive for me to go back to the mess again. but me being the eccentric righteous kind, just can't get the matter out of my head. 

i cannot digest the fact that an individual can bring one's life to shambles with their malicious lies, all because they're from a particular gender/group. i'm not making this a man v/s woman issue. i'm making it a truth v/s lies issue. no lie should be able to reign supreme, no matter the difference is in gender, race, class, creed, age etc. 

i cannot stand the fact that a lie could be so loud and destructive whereas my truth when came out, came out in silence. the court acquittal orders were issued at around 3pm by a clerk in an empty court room, judge wasn't even around. atrocities of the lies were loud, but my truth was barely a whimper.

i've always believed that human suffering should amount to a difference in ways of the world. if one has suffered, he must strive to ensure someone else doesn't face the same fate. if suffering goes unquestioned, then really, what is the point of it all? of this society? 

with these thoughts in mind, i consulted my lawyers and i wanted to press more than civil defamation charges. i wanted to press criminal charges because it is a criminal offence to file false firs, commit fraud and present false witnesses. my acquittal orders are already foolproof evidence to all these crimes. 


yet, yet....i have zero support. parents brushed aside my rebuttal saying that i better not get into it again since she can come up with any cock-and-bull story. i can't even begin to explain to them how irrational their fear is. i didn't relent. said i would take action myself with or without their help. finally, they gave in, said that they'd press charges on my behalf as my parents and that i focus on my future.

believing them, i moved to a new city for work and resumed my life. now, suddenly, they're singing a different tune. that they're too old to be taking all this stress, that they tell it for my own food, and that i should let it go too.

i cannot even!!!!! now, i'm stuck in a different city, with all the trauma, and all alone! if i wanna go back and take up the matter myself, i'll jeopardize my work, and i can't trust my parents to ever stand for me. 

so here i am, desolated from my homeland, dejected by my own, and destroyed by the only person i ever chose to love the most. 

what respite do i have? what action can i take? i'm no johnny depp, why would the world care when my own parents didn't? how can i, being thousands of miles away, even start to take legal action over this? 

it's actually super easy and convenient for me to put it all behind, but i simply cannot. if my own well-to-do parents would rather disown me again than stand by me just because it's a woman on the other end, what hope does any average man in india have? what hope does truth have over lies?

i need help. so that with my voice, i can help to ensure no other soul succumbs to malice in this deceitful world. that one day, i can fearlessly call out my perpetrator and encourage others to do the same.

humans of reddit, i appeal to you. please help! 

tl;dr - i left my parents for my love. 
              my love left me for her parents.
              her parents abetted her in framing me with false charges. 
i came out clean.
now my parents won't help me fight the lie. 

and i cannot let my suffering go pointless, since things really need to change in this country. old outdated laws must have no place. no woman should have unquestioned power to indict a man where he has no say. help!"
reddit,2024-05-06 01:16:15,"please suggest me some good and affordable non-judgemental psychiatrists for online consultation. major symptoms are listed below in description.  please suggest me some good non-judgemental psychiatrists for online consultation. my location: up east. 
symptoms &amp; problems i'm facing:
- inattentive (no matter how hard i try) 
- forgetful (i forget things while even thinking, and also forget very important things). recalling simple information, life event or words is also very hard for me. 
- unable to focus elsewhere if i know that i have some event/meeting/or something else planned at later time in the day, or next day, till then i keep thinking about the event, and can't do anything else till then. 
- for above point, even planner and reminder don't seem to work. 
- i want to speak a lot, but don't know why i feel very traumatized for speaking. so i stay silent (involuntarily) when others are asking for my opinions... 
- no matter how much i study, i don't seem to remember a thing. as a result, speaking on any topic is a challenge for me. even doing normal conversation has become challenging. i try to talk, and i don't get words and can't recall a single thing so that i can gice answers. speaking simple sentences become too difficult for even simplest of topics. 
- i have to re-read sentences, paragraph very frequently, and even after reading it, i don't seem to remember what i read, then i have to repeat it again. similar for speaking, i don't seem to remember what i'm speaking making me lose track of what to speak next. however, in my mind, i speak, not very fluently but it is still very articulated and well formed. but in real, when i have to speak, i lose my mind and get blank... 
- my brain doesn't seem to register events like, closing water tap, closing electric switch etc. i close electric switch and i have to stare it for a while in order to tell my brain that yes, i literally closed the switch. or else i have to go back to check again whether i closed it or not, i simply can't recall whether i closed the switch and have to go and see in order to be sure. similarly for closing water tap and closing jar lid, i have to repeatedly open and close till my brain accepts that yes, now i closed it. 
- quickly get anxious
depressed for career due to these habits as it is preventing me from giving interviews (which majorly depends on speaking skills) because i get blank and can't speak.
note: english language doesn't seem to be a problem, because speaking in my mother tongue hindi is also quite challenging. often times, i find expressing myself in hindi itself is more challenging than in english, in writing mode. and for speaking, i feel like i am not built for speaking. 

please help. if this is not the right sub-reddit for this question, please advice where can i ask this.
tia."

reddit,2024-05-07 16:24:15,"shocking scale of plastic pollution in india i was aware that despite the rise in awareness among the educated population about curbing their daily plastic waste, plastic pollution is still rising in most parts of india. however, this issue is much worse than i had imagined. i recently went on a weekend trip to alibaug, a beach town south of mumbai, and littering was evident practically throughout the trip. municipal cleanups seemed to be non-existent, and plastic dumps were everywhere, every few hundred meters along the road. a few years back, i went to rohtang pass in manali, and plastic bottles and wrappers covered the entirety of the high-altitude roads, frozen under the ice sheets, and these will stay there for centuries. i was in arunachal pradesh last year, and plastic bottles and carry bags flowed in the rivers, even in distant villages, leaving me speechless.

is there any solution to this grave problem that is only going to rise with increasing population and tourist concentration in the remotest locations of the country? why are plastic drinking water bottles sold in such ginormous quantities at every shack on every corner? why is the general civic sense among indian tourists so perilously low?

tl;dr: plastic pollution is on the rise throughout india, and the general lack of civic sense among tourists &amp; residents seems to be the prime reason."

reddit,2024-05-14 13:07:39,"what’s it gonna take for us as a society to finally care about air quality and climate change on a mass scale?  as an indian residing overseas, i visit india about twice a year and every time after i land, i get either a nasal infection, itchiness or face allergies which are not gone until i go back to my country of residence. doctors often point out that it is the reaction to the extreme air pollution. i know many people who face similar issues. living in an indian metropolis is equivalent to smoking multiple cigarettes daily. 

— i’m deeply concerned about the lack of widespread action and the unmuted response to the environmental emergencies. 

- we owe it to our parents who deserve to breathe fresh air in their golden years, to fellow citizens l, and future generations. they should inherit the nation that’s as beautiful and bountiful as its meant to be. 

- it goes beyond health. imagine getting unobscured view of the himalayas and our country being lauded for the beauty and cleanliness and us becoming a leader in promoting a cleaner and pristine natural environment, globally.

- in my country of residence , germany, parties are solely formed on the basis of environmental issues. ( green party for example) and elections can make or break on the basis of environmental issues.

- this also has to do with what we as a society demand from our law and policy makers. here i observe a huge pressure from the general population to breathe fresh air, get clean water and access to a ton of natural beauty to make living more fulfilling. 

- we are still way focussed on topics such as communal and religious politics, in an unhealthy proposition. 

- i am sure many people who have been in other parts of the world also more or less notice it. but it still hasn’t become a mainstream issue. none of the election  manifestos emphasise on those topics. i wonder what is it going to take to finally that to happen! 




edit: a lot of people are straight up jumping to developed cvs developing country comparison. my question is, is physics and ecology going to care and wait until your, mine and our loved ones’ bodies have permanent damages? are the ice glaciers going to wait for the next 50 years until india is developed and the wrongdoing in the past by other countries are balanced before cities like mumbai are submerged? and other extreme weather conditions? also why cannot we make our living conditions better if we see an obvious problem instead of jumping into ‘what-aboutism’ ?"

reddit,2024-05-22 19:01:44,"govt successfully met peak power demand in delhi without outages: atishi ""maybe delhi is the only state that gives 24-hour electricity. in the last three days when the heatwave has been intense, neighbouring cities have seen long power cuts. in greater noida housing societies, more than four hours of outages were reported. there were eight-hour-long power cuts in many sectors in noida. in many areas of ghaziabad there were six-hour long power cuts on may 21 and may 22,"" she alleged.

she claimed that there were 14-hour-long power cuts in loni. even in gurugram, there were power cuts, she said, adding that the bjp-ruled states have been witnessing power cuts.

""that is why bjp is fed up with delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal. he had promised 24 hours power supply to delhiites."

reddit,2024-05-26 08:26:18,"i want india to be clean but where tf do i put my trash? i've lived most of my life in oman. it is kept absolutely clean and tidy by the people and no doubt, the municipality employed cleaners who pick up the minimal trash from the roads, parks, etc. there's large dustbins every 50 -150 metres in residential areas that are emptied every morning by the tipper garbage trucks. parks and market areas have the smaller dustbins every so often as well. what i'm saying, is that you have no excuse to litter.

however whenever i visit my family in patna, it is absolutely filthy. empty residential lots resemble landfills. the sides of roads have mounds of garbage every so often. the metro construction has also messed up a lot of the busy roads from what i've seen. and again, nowhere to throw my trash if i'm outside. i will admit restaurants and vendors have small dustbins tucked away for their customers. but again, this should be the responsibility of the city right?

i've come to kota for coaching since the past year. much cleaner than patna, but still a bit lacking. i went for a run today and i saw 4 km of roads and just one of those large dustbins.

where is a normal person supposed to get rid of his trash when out and about? no wonder india is so dirty. the people aren't blameless and neither is the city management. thank you for reading my rant."

reddit,2024-05-28 21:47:24,"office air conditioning vs global warming i had to go out in the afternoon for some work, and realized how scalding hot the outdoors are. on one side i'm thankful that my white collar work allows me to sit in ac, otoh, i felt like i was contributing to it. 

1. for every 100mj of cooling done inside, ~130-150mj (or more for inefficient acs) of heating is done to the outside. now if people in offices raised the temperatures of the ac thermostat, they'd be able to reduce this impact substantially.

2. in large companies, the thermostat is often set really low, perhaps because the people in power wear suits, (when the ambient temperature in places like delhi/gurgaon is over 40 deg c), and then they set the temperatures to like under 20c. 

3. this is in addition to the fact that glass walled buildings in a weather like ours are a horrible idea, which further increases cooling costs. the glass they use is supposedly uv reflective, but it doesn't feel like the insides are any cooler (anecdotal, a neighbouring building is under construction, and doesn't have working ac, and the temperatures there are scalding as well, much higher than if they'd be made of cement).

clearly office architecture / air conditioning contributes towards local warming (slightly towards global warming as well). we should at least try to pluck the low hanging fruit here. 

**solutions?** 


now i'm not sure if there are easy ways to change building architecture, but at least increasing the indoor thermostat temperatures should be incentivized. a key idea to do the same would be to relax clothing norms, or at least look down upon companies that push top executives into wearing suits in such weather as well. 

today we are insulated from this weather, but we may not be tomorrow, and in either case, we can try to do our little bit to help others. 

what do you folks think? any other ideas?

he further said that despite the elevated demand, the power situation in delhi was under control, and so far there were no power cuts like in other states.

kejriwal pointed that due to the scorching heat and high temperatures, the demand for water had increased a lot in the city, and claimed that the water received in delhi from neighbouring states has reduced."

reddit,2024-06-01 12:41:14,"are most indians morally and ethically bankrupt?  i am sure most hindus, muslims, sikhs and christians are religious and conduct their religious duties (pooja, namaaz etc.) daily.  given the level of religiosity in the country on would think that indians would be very principled and moral people. 

yet we see numerous examples of moral and ethical bankruptcy:

1. **corruption**:  people in any government department ask for bribes so casually without considering what the other person is going through. those same people would probably have done a pooja or a namaz in the morning.

2. **lack of empathy**: people do not feel for the other person. they discriminate, mock and attack others over the smallest things be it religion, caste or community.

3. **lack of responsibility:** people are quick to blame others instead of owning up to their mistakes.

4. **lack of civic sense**: people throwing garbage anywhere, breaking traffic lights, driving like maniacs, breaking rules to look cool, cutting queues. 

maybe this post comes off as naive but i find us to be top-tier hypocrites. 

on one hand we say we are proud of being hindu/muslim/sikh but on the other hand we are the most principle-less people.

what makes us behave like that?"

reddit,2024-06-03 14:43:54,"no traffic signals at few places? while going to office from my home this morning , i observed at hal museum junction, the traffic signals were completely turned off. there was no green, no red or any other colour. this was creating a huge mess as the vehicles were coming from all directions. 


was this the case anywhere else? is it because of electricity problem due to the heavy rains yesterday or any other reason?"
reddit,2024-06-03 20:36:57,what should we do if a tree or electric post falls on our vehicle? in the last weekend downpour i saw lot of trees and electric posts fell down. many have fallen on the bikes and also cars trapping them under. just curious to know what should be done if we are in the situation. what’s the procedure and process to be followed if our vehicle gets trapped under tree or light post. what steps to be taken to claim insurance from the service centre? shall we clear the tree ourself if we can or do we have to wait until bbmp arrives?

reddit,2024-06-09 12:22:28,"title: successfully retrieved deposit from fraud landlord in bangalore - a must-read for newcomers and tenants! hey bangalore tenants community,

i wanted to share an experience that my sister and i had with a fraud landlord in green glenn layout, belandur, bangalore. this is especially important for all newcomers and tenants who might find themselves in similar situations.

**the background:** my sister rented a flat in green glenn layout last year. a significant red flag was that a single owner owned all 15 apartments in the building, managed through an agent. tenants had no direct contact with the owner, only a bank account number for rent deposits. the rental agreement was dropped off at the doorstep after being signed by the owner, and all communication went through the agent.

**the issue:** from january, the entire apartment faced water problems, with water available only for 2 hours a day. my sister discovered this was a tactic to force tenants out so the flats could be rented at higher prices. on the day my sister gave her one-month notice to move out, the water problem was miraculously fixed, and the agent finalized a new tenant at a 30% higher rent. the real harassment began when my sister asked about the return of her deposit. the agent stated that it would start ""processing"" one week after returning the key, with no committed return date.

**the plan:** sensing trouble, my sister contacted the previous tenant, who revealed that the landlord was a habitual fraudster. the previous tenant was harassed for two months before getting back only 60% of her deposit, with 40% deducted for unknown reasons. determined to avoid this fate, we took action.

**steps taken:**

1. **written notice:** we sent a letter to the owner (address found in the agreement), clearly stating the notice period and highlighting the clause that the deposit should be returned upon leaving the flat. we emphasized that withholding the money would be illegal and a breach of contract.
2. **legal threat:** we hinted to the agent that we were collecting evidence for the police or civil court, mentioning our prior experience with legal proceedings.
3. **tenant alliance:** we spoke with other tenants and discovered similar issues with the landlord. we formed a whatsapp group to gather evidence and present a united front.
4. **securing the flat:** when moving out, we locked the flat with two big chains and attached a notice stating that any attempt to break the lock or trespass would result in criminal charges (ipc 441 and 447) until the deposit was returned. we made it clear the flat legally remained with my sister.

**the outcome:** the next day, the agent called with a much softer tone, claiming they had never cheated any tenants. eventually, the owner agreed to a joint visit to the flat, and my sister received her full deposit back.

**key points to remember:**

1. **agreement clause:** ensure your rental agreement states that the security deposit will be returned at the time of leaving the flat and handing over the key.
2. **gather proof:** work together with other tenants and collect evidence.
3. **secure the apartment:** don't hand over the key until the deposit is returned. secure the flat to prevent unauthorized entry.
4. **legal options:** consider legal action if necessary. civil court costs include notice (₹5k), filing (₹20k), and per appearance (₹3k).

lastly, use resources like chatgpt to draft your notices and letters. don’t be afraid to stand up for your rights; not every owner is politically connected, and not every police officer is biased against outsiders.

stay vigilant and protect your rights!"

reddit,2024-06-12 05:38:49,"etiquette when travelling to japan .
as japan has relaxed the rules for indian tourists and many of us are now visiting, i thought to just give some tips/etiquettes you must follow as you will be representing our country.

1) follow queue everywhere, don’t jump it or cross it. goes for trains, grocery, everywhere. there is usually a line that you need to wait behind if you are next. don’t stand up close to the person in front of you and keep some personal space.
2) don’t talk loudly in public including over phone calls.
3) do not litter, carry your garbage with you and dispose in garbage bin when you find one.
4) always use zebra crossings, don’t cross from anywhere else. some crossings have signal, wait for it to turn green.
5) if your kid is one of those undisciplined one who yells and throws things around, please ensure to control them. japanese kids are extremely disciplined so such acts will be frowned upon.
6) be mindful of local culture, don’t not laugh or mock them under any circumstances.
7) try to learn few local greetings, comes handy.
8) accept cash, tickets, receipts with both hands.
9) there is no vip culture among general japanese people, please do not throw tantrums in hotels or other places to be treated like one. 

remember whenever you travel, you are ambassadors of our country so above should anyways be a standard practice. 

if i missed anything, please add.

edit: having read the comments, it is very reassuring that lot of us here agree that discipline is not a luxury but necessity and we also have a chance to be a great host nation for tourists. this gives me so much hope in our country that we are changing and not all is lost 🙌🏼"

reddit,2024-06-12 14:46:30,"iff’s submission to the un human rights committee ahead of india’s 4th periodic review | internet freedom foundation [https:\/\/internetfreedom.in\/un-periodic-review\/](https://preview.redd.it/wcaoo14rx36d1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa21d0656de8379fdd574382e1bb7647e68841e1)

# tl;dr

india’s move towards large-scale digitalisation has necessitated a critical look at law and policy instruments governing the space—which commonly appear to be vague, arbitrary, exclusionary, or fail to place human rights at their core. new laws and digital interventions seem to share the lack of public consultations and stakeholder participation. a spike in public-private partnerships across sectors is weakening transparency and accountability mechanisms. the 2019-2024 window is a crucial time for a deep assessment of the state of privacy, dignity, free speech, and several other constitutional guarantees of indian citizens, their interpretation in indian courts, and the need for rights-based legislation in the digital sphere. we noted all these concerns and more in our report to the united nations human rights committee ahead of their 4th periodic review of india.

# issue-wise analysis as enlisted by the committee

# an introduction to “digital india”

at the outset, we set context for the report by tracing india’s push towards digitalisation in the last five years. here, we spanned a few themes:

1. **the digital divide:** india suffers from a gaping digital divide, where factors of low literacy and unfamiliarity with emerging technological tools [~can impede~](https://static.internetfreedom.in/improving-internet-access-an-explainer/) many population groups from reaping the benefits of the internet and digital technologies recreationally as well as for better quality of life. this was especially seen during the covid-19 pandemic, where increased digitalisation and reliance on online tools across sectors like education, labour, and health, forced many to fall through the cracks (see [~here~](https://www.leidenlawblog.nl/articles/a-digital-platform-driven-covid-19-vaccine-drive-amidst-a-digital-divide-lessons-from-india?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [~here~](https://thewire.in/education/millions-of-indian-children-affected-by-covid-related-school-closures-digital-divide?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [~here~](https://www.epw.in/engage/article/how-covid-19-deepened-gender-fault-lines-indias?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)).
2. **connectivity:** recent [~government data~](https://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/qpir_23042024_0.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) reveals that 95.66% of total broadband subscribers (wired and wireless) and \~60% of the indian population access the internet through their wireless devices (mobiles and dongles). access to smartphones and internet is lower within women, especially rural women (see [~here~](https://www.gsma.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/the-mobile-gender-gap-report-2022.pdf?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=download-button&amp;utm_campaign=gender-gap-2022), [~here~](https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-insight/gender-equality/the-digital-divide-and-is-it-holding-back-women-in-india-101641971745195.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [~here~](https://india.unfpa.org/en/news/stage-has-been-set-gender-equity-digital-india?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)). read iff’s [~connectivity tracker~](https://internetfreedom.in/tag/connectivitytracker/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) for more analysis on this issue. union government’s efforts to enhance connectivity, namely pmgdisha and bharatnet, [~significantly lag~](https://internetfreedom.in/legislative-brief-2024-budget/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) behind in fulfilling their targets.
3. **data protection law:** the lack of an adequate (or active) data protection law is a big concern. the digital personal data protection act (“**dpdpa**”), 2023 was passed and notified in 2023 after a long and winding journey through committees and consultations. yet, its final version seemed unrecognisable and was never opened up for public scrutiny and consultation. in its present form, the act [~falls short~](https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-first-read-of-the-draft-digital-personal-data-protection-bill-2023/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) on many counts.
4. **digital india:** our ‘digital india’ programme envisions large-scale digitalisation across sectors, which also means large-scale data collection and processing. the programme does not properly address foundational encumbrances like infrastructural capacity, tech-preparedness, and digital divide, and operates without an adequate data protection regime in place. our concerns around the programme include socio-economic exclusion cast by welfare sector digitalisation, ‘indiastack’ and the lack of transparency and accountability within it, and a worrying roll-out of digital public infrastructures.

# gendered harms on the internet

we noted that persistent incidents of sexual harassment and doxxing have made social media platforms highly unsafe and toxic for women in the last five years, which may lead some of them to disengage from social media altogether. most notably, the ‘boiz locker room’ incident targeting school-going girls in 2020 (read our analysis [~here~](https://internetfreedom.in/the-internet-shouldnt-be-a-boys-club/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)) and the sulli and bulli deals incident targeting muslim women in 2021 (read our analysis [~here~](https://internetfreedom.in/womens-safety-on-the-internet-intersectionality/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)) point to the prevalent gendered harms online, and lack of adequate action by authorities, and sometimes even platforms. as per a recent global witness and iff [~investigation~](https://internetfreedom.in/report-misogynistic-hate-speech/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), content that targeted women on the basis of gender (including islamophobic, racist, and casteist hate), was kept live on youtube and koo in both the us and india despite violating companies’ own policies. 

# censorship of communal speech online

we noted two significant instances. in august 2023, tweets related to a [~video~](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/muzaffarnagar-slapping-case-sc-directly-criticises-uttar-pradesh-in-case-of-teacher-goading-students-to-slap-muslim-classmate/article67733661.ece?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) showing a school teacher in muzaffarnagar, uttar pradesh instructing students to abuse and physically harm a fellow muslim student, were [~reportedly~](https://theleaflet.in/the-curious-case-of-censorship-in-the-aftermath-of-muzaffarnagar-viral-video/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) taken down from x (formerly twitter) pursuant to orders sent by the ministry of information and broadcasting. when asked, the ministry denied access to blocking orders, citing the national security exemption under different laws, which we have analysed in depth in [~this post~](https://internetfreedom.in/muzaffarnagar-slapping-incident-censorship/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). secondly, in may 2024, an x post by the bharatiya janata party’s karnataka unit triggered nationwide outrage due to its communal attack on the indian national congress. the karnataka police, after being [~directed~](https://indianexpress.com/elections/ec-bjp-karnataka-x-post-muslims-9314058/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to do so by the election commission of india, asked x to take down the controversial post. 

# state of privacy, data protection, and surveillance

in this section, we summarised issues in relation to the following sub-themes pertaining to data privacy and protection:

1. **the puttaswamy standard:** we underlined the significance of *justice (retd.) k. s. puttaswamy v. union of india \[(2017) 10 scc 1\],* or the puttaswamy judgement—where a nine-judge bench of the indian supreme court unanimously affirmed that the right to privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed under part iii of the constitution of india, and prescribed the five-pronged puttaswamy standard that any privacy-infringing measure must meet: (a) existence of a legitimate state interest; (b) suitability (rational nexus between the measure and goal); (c) necessity (least restrictive way of achieving the goal); (d) proportionality *stricto sensu* (balance between the extent of infringement and strength of the goal); (e) the existence of procedural safeguards.
2. **weak foundations of aadhaar:** there is strong evidence from the last decade to suggest that aadhaar linkage has instead led to exclusion, potential citizen surveillance and profiling, and a range of privacy concerns. while optional on paper, aadhaar has been thrust upon populations and made mandatory in practice across sectors through the years. in this section, we spanned themes of aadhaar integration in public and private sectors and lawfulness thereof, and the long list of vulnerabilities of aadhaar data and inadequacy of state response thereto.
3. **an inadequate data protection law:** as noted above, we expanded on the [~shortcomings~](https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-first-read-of-the-draft-digital-personal-data-protection-bill-2023/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) of the present dpdpa, 2023.
4. **surveillance through cms:** the centralised monitoring system (“**cms**”) enables state e-surveillance and monitoring of text messages, social-media engagement, and phone calls on landlines and cell phones, among other communications, which severely jeopardises privacy. we [~explored~](https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-2-the-centralised-monitoring-system/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) how cms does not meet transparency and accountability standards.

# state of free speech in india

1. **the right to peaceful protests:** indian citizens have the fundamental right to protest, drawing from the right to free speech and expression i.e. article 19(1)(a) and freedom of peaceful assembly i.e. article 19(1)(b) of the constitution. while this right is not absolute and can be limited by reasonable restrictions, such restrictions must be necessary, proportionate, and follow procedures established by law. we noted many instances of digital repression (by censorship and internet shutdowns) and protest surveillance, which have a chilling effect on this right without meeting necessity or proportionality standards.
2. **internet shutdowns:** as india emerged as the country with the highest number of internet shutdowns in 2023, we trace our five-year history of such suspensions, exploring the statutory basis for internet shutdowns in india and the compliance mandate laid down in *anuradha bhasin v. union of india \[air 2020 sc 1308\].* we studied how shutdowns play out in practice with a focus on human rights violations associated with cutting off access to digital resources and briefly highlight an [~ongoing~](https://internetfreedom.in/gauhati-hc-internet-shutdown-rules-update?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) challenge to the validity of the legal instrument legitimising internet shutdowns. 
3. **digital censorship:** over the last five years, we have seen concerning trends in online content blocking, website blocking, and social media account blocking, and how judicial interpretation of existing legal provisions giving the government powers to censor do not remedy the situation vastly. we also noted that existing online censorship practice in india falls afoul of prevailing legal norms, specifically the precedent set by the supreme court in *shreya singhal v. union of india, \[air 2015 sc 1523\].* we reiterated our [~concerns~](https://internetfreedom.in/comments-on-the-broadcasting-bill-2023/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) on the broadcasting services (regulation) bill, 2023 and new attacks on journalistic expression and creative freedom. 
4. **deficiencies in the it rules:** platforms are governed in india through a network of laws, including three notable amendments to the information technology (“**it**”) act, 2000. these are the it (intermediary guidelines and digital media ethics code) rules, 2021, amendment rules, 2022 to the it rules, 2021, and amendment rules, 2023 to the it rules, 2021. we charted their regulatory mechanisms and impact on free speech online, covering the arbitrary content blocking and takedown powers they confer and their misguided attempt to tackle “misinformation” by mandating grievance appellate committees (read our analysis [~here~](https://internetfreedom.in/we-wrote-to-the-gac-seeking-answers/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)) or setting up state-backed fact-check units (read our response [~here~](https://internetfreedom.in/statement-on-the-notification-of-the-it-amendment-rules-2023/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)). 
5. **threats to end-to-end encryption:** india’s intent to build backdoors to end-to-end encrypted platforms for access to law enforcement agencies presents an undemocratic and unconstitutional framework for the regulation of online content. we traced the mandate of rule 4(2) of the it rules, 2021, which can require messaging services (such as whatsapp) to enable identification of the “first originator” of a message, the cyber security directions issued by indian computer emergency response team which can require vpns and other specified entities to maintain logs for up to five years, and the new telecommunications act, 2023.
6. **press harassment and intimidation:** we noted the alarming use of spyware or threats of use of spyware by state authorities on the devices of journalists, researchers and opposition leaders, which reportedly happened at least twice in these five years. the [~lax response~](https://internetfreedom.in/pegasus-2-months-on-still-no-investigation/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) of indian authorities to pegasus and allegations of [~planted evidence~](https://www.accessnow.org/india-malware/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) during criminal proceedings against human rights defenders was deafening, but [~was also seen~](https://internetfreedom.in/a-worm-in-the-apple-iff-writes-to-cert-in-as-it-begins-probe-into-apples-state-sponsored-attack-notification/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) when apple, inc. recently sent threat notifications to journalists and opposition leaders about potential state-sponsored attack on their devices.
7. **sedition:** in the past five years, there has been a notable misuse of section 124-a of the indian penal code, 1860 which criminalises the vague offence of ‘sedition.’ we noted the recurrent firs filed under the provision even as the supreme court, while hearing a pending challenge to the constitutional validity of section 124-a, has issued a historic order suspending all pending trials, appeals, and proceedings under it until the law is re-examined. 

this is a (very) concise summary of our report to the unhrc ahead of their 4th periodic human rights review of india. we thank the committee for undertaking this significant and timely exercise and giving civil society organisations like iff the opportunity to draw from their work and provide diverse perspectives to the process.

reddit,2024-06-17 08:21:07,"open letter to indian tourist from nepal  dear indians,

we recognize and appreciate our close cultural, traditional, and culinary connections, which make us see you as brothers and part of our extended family. however, we have noticed that many indian tourists do not adhere to appropriate ethics and values when visiting other countries, including nepal. 

it's disheartening to see issues like littering and loud behavior becoming prevalent among some of you. please remember to conduct yourselves respectfully when abroad. we are growing weary of the noise and the mess left behind. is common sense really that uncommon?

with the heat waves, many indians are traveling to nepal, often by road. the main concern is the disregard for local rules. do you realize the number of indian drivers facing violence due to their arrogance? the mindset of ""i paid money, so i can do anything"" is fostering animosity between nepalese and indians.

many of you arrive in buses, bringing all necessary materials and then cooking by the roadside. while we don’t mind this (though we encourage supporting local hotels), it is unacceptable to leave garbage behind. in nepal, there is a small fee of 10-20 nrs (5-10 ic) to use public toilets, yet many choose to relieve themselves roadside to avoid this fee. if you cannot afford to pay for basic amenities, why come to nepal at all? please do not treat our country like your own dumping ground.

while we remain grateful for the aid and support from india, the behavior of some tourists is creating resentment. let's strive to maintain the strong bond between our nations by respecting each other’s countries and following local rules and norms.

.........................

reddit,2024-06-19 23:07:25,"i'm honestly appalled and deeply disturbed by the current state of the packaged food industry in india  the news and posts i've been reading recently are nothing short of horrifying. just when you think it couldn't get worse, it does. 

first, we had the disgusting incident of a finger found in an ice cream. a literal human finger. how does something like this even happen? then there was the rubbery plastic thing discovered in amul lassi. are we drinking milk or some toxic plastic concoction? and let's not forget the blade in the air india flight food. it's terrifying to think that our in-flight meals could actually harm us.

the horrors don't stop there. a rat in hershey’s syrup? what are we consuming, really? and to top it all off, we find out that the masala powders we use daily contain cancer-causing elements. what the actual hell is going on?

it's as if our lives are so cheap to these companies that they think they can feed us literal garbage and we'll still buy it. the level of disrespect is staggering. how much more of this nonsense are we supposed to tolerate? how many more health hazards and revolting discoveries do we need before we realize that our health and well-being are at serious risk?

people need to be extremely angry about what's happening in our country. we should be outraged, not just mildly concerned. these incidents are not isolated; they are part of a systemic problem where quantity trumps quality, and our safety is an afterthought.

maybe it’s time to stop buying packaged food altogether. enough is enough. it’s clear that the packaged food industry in india is in a deplorable state, and it’s high time we took these issues seriously. let's demand better for ourselves and our families. our health should never be compromised for the sake of corporate profit."

reddit,2024-06-22 22:37:59,"traffic fine app that will solve traffic issues once and for all. need  idea validation/feedback. currently, every city in india struggles with severe traffic issues. addressing these challenges requires comprehensive solutions, including improved road planning and substantial infrastructure investments. however, these measures are costly and offer only short-term relief. a significant daily problem is reckless driving, with many individuals committing offenses without consequence due to inadequate enforcement. while some violations are captured on camera, fines are rarely paid.

imagine if every smartphone user in bangalore could act as a traffic enforcer. the bangalore traffic police (btp) already has an app for reporting violations, but it is underutilized, and few offenders actually pay fines. the lack of incentives for reporting is a major hurdle.

now where this app comes in the picture is  users report violations through photos and videos. now once uploaded , btp actually verifies if it is actually a traffic offense , once verified and then through the number plate and vehicle registration details , the fine/notice is sent to the vehicle owner through 3 ways, whats app, sms , if the user is registered in the app , through the app as well.  now comes the actual moat of the app and i know this might sound stupid , but here me out . so the vehicle owner will be forced to pay the fine and the money does not go to btp , it goes to the person who reported the fine. now comes the actual hard part , btp or karnataka govt needs to pass this as a law or something , failure to pay the fine within 7 days would result in the fine getting multiplied by 10x or 50x and now it would be the responsibility of btp to collect dues from the offender. when the fine is 10x to 50x they would obviously go and collect why because it's quite a lot of money for a violation , and it improves the income of the traffic police. with 10 to 50x fine for a traffic violation they can mint money .

in an ideal scenario, the ease of earning money would encourage widespread use of the app, and habitual offenders would be compelled to pay fines or face severe penalties with btp knocking on their doors. major violators like auto rickshaws, cabs, and transport vehicles, which are linked to various apps, could have fines deducted from their earnings. proof of violations would be accessible through their partner apps (uber, ola, namma yatri, porter, etc.).

i know there might be some loopholes and i am expecting too much from the btp , but need your thoughts."

reddit,2024-06-23 13:51:23,"why are indians so racist against each other (maharashtra centric post) ok this post is going to be controversial. but hear me out. 

we all like to pretend that we are one united nation frolicking together with dialogues like 'unity in diversity' and 'abdul, ramesh, sarvanna, anthony, ranjit are together'. 

but the reality seems to be much different. i am not even going to talk about caste or religion. for the purposes of this post assume that 100% people i am speaking about are not casteist. 

even then people don't seem to think of people from other states or even opposite sides of their own states as equal. i regularly see so many dialogues like 'he is a punjabi paaji' or 'he is a up bhaiyya stealing our mumbai jobs' kind of rhetoric. now i understand the jobs thing to a very small extent. but if you don't want people from other states in your own country to take jobs in your state then why the f do you want a united india?

the shiv sena rhetoric bores and disgusts me. why can't up, bihar people have jobs in mumbai? 

remember that when india was made, states were supposed to be administrative divisions only. our country is one. people in berlin don't complain when french people take their jobs let alone people from other german states like bavaria or baden. those up, bihar people are 'taking' your jobs because they work hard and don't complain. meanwhile my own marathi people (especially in places like pune) are notorious for their snark remarks, general laziness and an inability to show respect to the customer. i am aware that there are many good ones but the city of pune in particular is proud of their disrespectful attitude with quotes like 'punyat apaman honarach' (in pune you will be insulted). then of course your jobs are gonna be taken by polite sweet tongued gujuratis, marwadis, biharis and others. 

this sort of thing also happens in south india btw. where some people who know hindi refuse to speak it on purpose.

i also think that the indian problem of ugly cities and thrashing is partly related to this issue. when you don't see people of your own country as your brothers. when you treat them like foreigners then you will never ever see the spaces that you cohabit as 'belonging to you'. when you stop seeing these public places as 'yours' then of course you will not feel anything bout throwing garbage or thrashing them

its high time indians start considering other indians as their own. only after that will public spaces improve."

what should i keep in mind in terms of dos and don’ts as exceptions?

is water shortage a really serious issue if u am willing to live in decent well maintained society near marathahalli (my office is near that and i want to minimise travel to 10-15 min)?

language related violence is really very common or they will get irked if you do something or one or two mental cases you can come across in a month ?

correct me if i am wrong - transport is costly as compared to mumbai, food prices are similar, accommodation are cheaper, traffic is more but not that what is exaggerated, difficult to find chapatis and good sabzi (north indian food), cook/maid charges i am not aware (in mumbai i give 4k-5k for one meal, in the posh area


thanks for reading if you made it through"

reddit,2024-06-25 23:42:38,"i became a victim of a financial fraud. hello everyone, i am a victim of a financial fraud that is growing in india these days. the greed to get quick rich made me fall into a pit from where it is never coming back. the name of the scam is called [pcm](https://www.pcmests.com/). it works by asked you to recharge on their app and by products. these products give you income each day. say you buy a product worth rs. 3500 and your per day income is rs. 175 for the next 52 days. so it will result in around 2.5x profit. but they will not let you complete that 52 days. they will just remove you one day randomly. the mentor that was talking to you everyday will just stop seeing your text, then you can go on calling them or do anything there is nothing that can be done. they also give bonuses on bring in new members. when they remove you they will also remove all your members so that no one can question your removal or anything. best part is their whatsapp numbers aren't even indian, it's some fake uk (+44) number. i'm a student and it's devastating for me. i lost more than 7 thousand rupees in this scam.

please i request everyone to be aware of it and don't fall into such potholes. this fraud specially focuses on students or old age people like our parents. please stay aware and keep others aware."

reddit,2024-06-26 11:51:23,"please don't make of kashmir what you have made of shimla/manali dear tourists,

as a kashmiri, i welcome you to visit the famous dal lake, the meadows of gulmarg, lidder valley in pahalgam, and other places in kashmir that you want. for one, it brings a lot of revenue for local businesses. even though i don't have an occupation related to tourism, many of my friends and family benefit from it and i welcome everyone.

but, please stop with the littering and have some civic sense.

dal lake was my go to for cycling every evening but now i've stopped it. i don't feel like going there because of the heaps of garbage around the banks of the lake, and floating food wrappers and other plastic waste in the lake. it's a common sight to see dl, hr and gj cars parked on the footpath around the lake's perimeter blocking path for pedestrians and cyclists.

even at places like gulmarg, pahalgam and sonmarg, the ecosystem is dying and it's common to see cars parked on river beds at some places with heaps of garbage around it. if you can carry packaged food and other stuff in your cars to the mountains, you can most certainly bring it back in the same car.

as a kashmiri, it is very saddening to see all this happening to the place i call home.

all this combined with the short sighted growth plan of current cebtral government has taken a toll on kashmir's ecosystem. the current push to tourism has resulted in hundreds of acres of forest land being cleared for hotels and other 'development' projects around boulevard road, doodhpathri, gurez and other places. that is something kashmiris feel helpless about and that is a topic for a long and detailed article.

but atleast as tourists, you can be more sensible and not make the place you visit a hell for the locals."

reddit,2024-06-30 15:31:20,"the petulance !  **this post has been written by 3 parts of me**  
the inner critic , the inner child, and the inner adult.

i am 40 years olf. lovely wife. 2 kids.

i have certain borderline traits, but over time, with dbt and cbt, my mindset has changed and i have really ensured that the trauma i have does not get passed to my kids. this may sound like a lot of could and would and should and what ifs, but i think i need to tell this story.  
  
i'm not the best at what i do, but i work hard.  
there's a lot of stress i take for work, and that's not going to go away. my wife also expects a lot from me, and i like making her happy. so that’s not going to go away either.

my wife earns more than i do, and that’s perfectly okay. if i could be a stay at home dad, i would love it.

i had a breakdown in 2022 at work, couldn't manage my emotions well, and started talking about killing myself.  
  


 

the incident got escalated, and i had to leave that job. that made me realise that it takes only 1 slip to make you from favorite to failure.  
  
in 2023, i got admitted to the hospital due to a tia (a minor minor stroke)

i quit my job last january and decided to take a plunge into consulting.  my wife was so supportive. my whole family was. and it worked well, i immediately gopt 2 contracts for the first 6 months.  
  


from january to june, i was working as a retainer consultant. now the retainer contracts are over, and i'm trying to get business. i decided to give it a year.

and now, somehow i am less stressed setting up consulting than i was in my job.  
  
when i got the initial assignments, i thought this consulting thing was easy, and i got cocky. but now i'm out in the water, trying to get my business off the ground. there are days when i like doing it, but when i don't see an immediate result, it makes me feel a fear of failure and a lack of validation.  
  
but all said and done, despite the stress of setting up a consulting business, i am so much happier and my relationships with people have improved. somehow, i'm much less stressed than i was earlier.

**but i am having a panic attack right now!**

  
when i quit, my assumption was that we could run the house on her salary (she earns thrice of what i do).

my wife and i just sat on finances .we're still falling short. and this is at our lowest expense, it cannot go any further than this.  
we will need money. and i cannot be the one not pitching in,  
hence the panic attack

**central question** :

if i get a job, our money woes will be solved, but then i will go back to the nervous wreck i was or if not that then for sure i will have a slip up and that’s not going to go down well. it happened in 2022 where i had a nervous breakdown at work. and in 2023 i was admitted to the hospital because of a transient ischemic stroke. all it takes is 1 slip up.  
  
  
**anytime i have held a job** –

there has not been a day i have not stressed about delivering over and above. it is just ingrained in me. i used to work in a really toxic industry and anyways i had to spend nights, and had to face a lot at work (bipolar boss, constant yelling etc..). but that is just what it is. i cant change the way the industry works.  
on top of that i tried to reach a very high standard so more than others, i expected a lot from myself . i have managed to work on this and actually aim for excellence.  
  
**personality traits !**  
i am curious, empathetic, and persevering. i'm not the best at anything, but i love learning. i'm an anxious person by nature, i need a lot of validation, and i want to make everyone around me happy and meet everyone's expectations.  
  
sometimes, i learn for validation, but many times i love learning just for the heck of it. i will learn psychology, mythology, philosophy, sociology, physics, biology, anything. i love a life of quiet contemplation, writing and reading.

**ut now**  
  
**i am having a panic attack. my inner critic is getting louder. my what ifs are putting me in a psace where i fear for everything. i cannot breathe.**

i have some options in front of me.

i have 3 options:

**option 1**

get a job immediately and give up trying to set a business: i've been working in an industry which is really toxic. i'm more sensitive than most, and i'm zero on office politics. i spend a lot of time at work – i work really long hours. it's not a problem with me, everyone in the industry faces this. it just hits me harder because my work gives me a lot of validation.

positives: that would solve our money issues immediately.

negatives: work long hours, be stressed, lose spending time with kids, stressful situation with my wife, not meeting her expectations, not meeting kids expectations, not meeting my own expectations

what if i break down again! what if i slip again. now i cannot afford it, because this is going to cost me a lot!  
  
**option 2**

continue to try and set up consulting

positives – drive which comes from within, being able to monetise my full set of skills, being able to do different kinds of work. in the long run, i am pretty confident that i sould be able to earn more than what i would make in a job, with much less stress.  
i get to spend time with my kids, i get to see them grow up and i get to see my lovely wife and make sure i seduce her every day. somehow, i am nor as worried about this taking off. but the minor chance that this wont tyake off is still a luxury we cannot take  
  
negatives – a chance of failure. we will be spending more than we earn.  
though i have given myself a year, what if i quit consulting in june, only to figure out that my big break was coming in july, or what if i am not good enough  
  
**option 3**  
take a job which is less stressful and toxic

positives – obviously less stress. less money, but manageable.  
no negatives as such, but will be tough. i don’t know how to do anything else, going to school is not an option. i would love for someone to hire me, but switching careers at 40 is tough.

i would really like to believe that i will be able to handle all emotions with grace and honour but some times the dbt and cbt exercises don’t serve me at all and i get emotionally distressed. trouble is, i cannot have  another breakdown at work. but if i don’t get a job, we may have to live beyond our means for a while. and if i do get a job, what if i break down?  
  
the adult says it sound like i am looking for excuses to go back to a job and be miserable in an environment i know over trying to work as a consultant and get out of my comfort zone.  
  
the critic says – you are doomed either ways

the child just wants to eat."

it can’t be generic like infrastructure, it should be specific. if it’s infrastructure related, something like metro connectivity for the whole city or regular buses or wider roads. it can’t be just “fix infrastructure”."

reddit,2024-07-02 23:23:54,"stray cattle and indian road needs to separate. in such a crowded country of 1.4bn+ people where traffic jams are so common. the roads are full of potholes. for people, it's difficult to walk or drive on the road safely, especially in certain peak hours. why stray castles are freely roaming on the road? sometimes standing in the middle of the road, or engaging in a fight and causing chaos. seems like everyone is okay with the situation and compromises with it. in such a modern world still, such a thing is happening in our country, it's just shameful and dangerous. road accidents and deaths due to stray castles are common. i have also heard about accidents and deaths due to stray cattle in my area. these animals also suffer a lot; some die by eating plastic or succumb to injury. the cow is holy for name's sake in this country. even though my post won't change the situation, or solve the problem, i felt like making this post and raising the issue would at least release my frustration about this situation or keep this issue in the discussion."

reddit,2024-07-10 11:45:16,"china’s hegemony over india china has gone ahead and renamed 11 places in arunachal pradesh, calling it ‘southern tibet.’ in response, prime minister modi assures us, “no one has intruded into our territory, nor is any of our posts under anyone else’s control.” ah, the joys of political spin!

one might wonder, is it part of a prime minister’s constitutional duty to tell tall tales for the sake of national interest? after all, who needs facts when you have good old-fashioned denial? it’s like saying, “the cake isn’t missing; it just relocated to someone else’s stomach.”

is a cowardly prime minister good for the country? well, if we’re looking to win awards for creative storytelling, perhaps! but for dealing with territorial intrusions? maybe not so much. modi’s refusal to even mention china by name, despite the alleged occupation of indian land, is a masterclass in the art of avoidance. it’s as if voldemort taught him that “he-who-must-not-be-named” trick.

imagine a burglar in your house, and you simply decide to call him an “uninvited guest” and avoid mentioning him altogether. problem solved, right? if we could bottle modi’s level of denial, we might just solve the global water crisis.

in conclusion, while modi’s approach might keep the headlines light and the narrative tight, one has to wonder: is this really the kind of leadership we need? or should we start calling it “alternative facts” territory?"

reddit,2024-07-10 20:49:41,"went to report sexual harassment, but police are threatening to put me in jail. from last 2 years the uncle living next door has been molesting me and touching me inappropriately every time i have to go through common passage. to give some context, me and my mom live in the old style apartments where you have to pass the next house to get to the stairs. i'm 27 years old female and this person has two daughters that are almost the same age as me. the passage is very small and he stands there shirtless and blocks my way, if i ask him to give way he screams and says build your own stairs. he always shouts, tries to physically intimidate me and supress me every time. he has always stood there shirtless and gives very less space for me to walk and every time i have passed next to him, he has touched me inappropriately and sexually harassing me multiple times. we went through this torture for more than 2 years and we couldn't take it anymore so we decided to move away from that place. when i tried to question him openly, he threatened to cut our cable, internet and electric wires, because they pass in front of his home. i have taken photos of him blocking the entire way and sitting shirtless in the passage way.

after a week of moving to new place i went to govindrajnagar police station to file a complaint against him but the police are not ready to take my complaint.

first they asked me to come another time and when i reached there they had called this person and said please adjust and resolve it yourself. first of all they wanted me to 'adjust' with this person who had been molesting me for 2 years. i said no and wanted to move forward with the complaint. then they said come back next week to meet the sp. i came back and then the constable had called the molester as well. he said sorry and that he won't do it again and to not give the complaint. i said i still wanted to move forward with the complaint. then the guy suddenly said , okay then i'll also give a complaint saying you molested my wife. the constable said , if he gives a complaint then i'll have to confiscate your visa, you will lose your job and you'll have to go to jail unnecessarily, so please take the complaint back

i have no clue what to do now. can anyone please help. i know they have absolutely no case. but the police just joined hands with this person.

and everytime i go to the station this person is already there. i don't know if he has any connections, but he seems to be friends with all the constables.

all of the neighbours are proof of what he does. we've fought multiple times.

one side of me wants to not get in trouble of court and case but the two years of torture and harassment should not go unchecked. i want this person to be punished. i don't want him to do the same to other people.

can anyone help me with my next steps legally or otherwise? i haven't been able to sleep in this new house even though the only reason we decided to move far away was because we wanted to sleep peacefully."

reddit,2024-07-11 16:26:52,"duplicate vehicle numberplate being used. hello, 

a fraud is using my vehicle numberplate and raking up a lot of fines. we informed the cops in december and they asked us not to pay those fines and said they have sent an alert message but they haven't taken any action yet.

there is another major problem. we had an existing icici fastag and the fraud brought a hdfc fasttag either with fake documents or no documents. icici bank closed our fasttag without informing us. but, hdfc is not willing to close the frauds fastag without informing him. and they are unable to contact him. we have submitted an official letter from the cops and all the vehicle documents and they are not taking any action. we are unable to travel on toll roads without taking a hit on our wallets.

please advise what steps we can take to get this issue fixed.

thanks."

reddit,2024-07-12 12:47:54,"deposit scam, owner deducted 1 lakh from deposit we were living in 1 fully furnished apartment(rent: 55k and security deposit 3 lakhs) for 2 years and suddenly owner asked us to vacate within 4-5 days because he had to give the flat to his relatives. we said it’s not possible for us to vacate immediately but we started looking out since owners can remove tenants with 2 months notice.

we vacated the flat in 25 days(20th june). the financer of owner came for flat inception on the same day. he said no damaged but was constantly saying he will deduct 1 month painting charges(55k rupees). since this was in contract we couldn’t fight for it even though he was removing us.

next day, the financer called that he got the check of 2 lakhs from the owner and that he’s coming to collect the keys. we asked for the breakdown for 1 lakh that he deducted but he didn’t knew. for 10 days we tried calling the owner to understand the breakdown but he wasn’t picking the call. 

we told the financer that we can’t give the keys until we know the reason for deducting 1 lakh rupees. after 1 week of not picking calls, the owner went to dubai. 

now, after 20 days he finally picked the call and is saying you didn’t give keys so pay 1 more month and close this with his secretary (who also was not picking the call earlier). he’s arguing that you should have come to the office to discuss. he’s blaming us for not giving keys while he still hasn’t explained the reason for deducting 1 lakh rupees. 

the behaviour of owner is also very rude, he says what he wants and cuts the call saying talk to the secretary. then secretary and financer say you talk to owner. the owner is super rich and powerful, and runs a big restaurant chain in bangalore.


we don’t want to involve in a legal fight to get justice. at max we will get 45k after painting charges deduction. what else should we do to get back our hard earned money?"

think of a street or a lane without tall poles running heavy gauge wires but a led street light like we see in townships and not to mention some of these poles makes car parking such a painful process."

reddit,2024-07-16 22:58:35,"the one truth that can explain everything wrong with india. i saw a journalist on twitter post a video of a man carrying his dead wife on his shoulder, exiting a hospital and marching his way home quite a distance away. the journalist mentioned in his caption how there’s no dignity in death, and there’s no ambulance or vehicle to carry the body home.

however, i saw nothing wrong in it. this journalist was speaking with a strange expectation, something i call, “big city standards.” people in much of india have been living this way for hundreds of years. doesn’t he realize that?

all of the problems that us big city folk feel, can be attributed to a misplaced expectation of 21st century modern city standards on a country that is still largely pre industrial, living in the agricultural age, and even in the agricultural age, much of india still lives with back breaking field work in sweltering heat using primitive tools.

let me remind you all that only 30% of india lives in cities with some semblance of 21st century life. 70% of india lives in the pre industrial age, with lives comparable to pre wwi era. they might have cellphone connectivity and mobile phones, but their lives have largely not changed in the past hundred years, not by much anyway.

i see lot of indians complaining on the lack of civic sense amongst indians. a lot of indians, even city dwellers do not know how to use a western cubicle to do their business. we see on gutka stains on the walls of public buildings or walls. we see garbage thrown on the streets (garbage segregation?! what’s that?). open defecation is still a thing. poor driving discipline. all of this is to be blamed on us not reaching the 21st century yet. we are hundreds of years behind. 

social change in the west, with movements such as feminism, human rights and equality rode on the back economic improvements powered by the industrial revolution. people in india either forget, or are simply not aware that india has not yet reached 21st century levels of industrialization. so even, socially, we remain a backward country with poor regard for women’s rights or human rights.

even our democracy hasn’t reached 21st century standards because of this reason. we have a gdp per capita around the 2000$ range, with 800 million dependent on govt ration to feed themselves. putting people behind bars without a trial, and keeping them there for years is totally okay with the morals of  70% rural population and a big chunk of city dwellers are immigrants from rural areas. not tolerating criticism and always having your sentiments hurt is also a symptom of being an underdeveloped nation. just look at the way the laws are framed in this country, it resembles less like a developed democratic country and more similar to some autocratic regime. free speech is a joke in this country. innocent until proven guilty is a joke in the country. justice delivery is a joke. indian police procedure is a joke!

the indian middle class which has slogged all its life studying for competitive exams and lives in broken cities with falling bridges, airports and hoardings, while traversing through flooded and pot hole infested roads basically does government charity for 5-6 months of a year. majority of tax is generated by them in these cities and all of that goes in subsidizing the lives of farmers and rural folk who don’t know what modern farming is, stubbornly refuse to listen to learned minds and are a perennial loss making venture, and default on all their loans only for the govt to waive it off, all at the expense of the taxpayer. they resist any kind of farm reform, and their resistance is violent sometimes, and keep increasing their demands for subsidies and keep demanding the govt buy their shitty produce at a price that they set with no regard for market forces. some idealistic middle class city dwellers call them “annadattas” and support them but they’re so brain dead cos they don’t realize that the failure of farmers to adopt modern farming is making their lives more expensive cos the govt has to extract the money from somewhere and it just so happens that the middle class is the most dependable cash cow.

the politicians can’t do much no matter who it is, because they’ve to cater to 70% ignorant, uneducated people from the 17th century. not to mention staggering levels of corruption at all levels of industry and government. i expect nothing more from a 2000$ gdp per capita country. 

if you realize this one truth about india, you will pack your bags and make for greener pastures. cos ain’t nobody got hundreds of years to wait for india to become developed. btw, it is getting harder and harder to move to a developed country. while we still live in agricultural age, with primitive tools, developed countries are moving to the artificial intelligence age. 


tldr ; india is a pre industrial primitive agricultural country. it is improper to expect 21st century standards of life from a country where huge populations live like it’s the 17th century. the dignity of life, civic sense, consciousness of democratic rights, freedom of speech, fair justice system, humane police procedures etc are too utopian for common indian to access. it’ll take hundreds, if not thousands of years to achieve current western standards of life, dignity and democracy. those who can leave, should leave for greener pastures."

reddit,2024-07-17 15:00:41,"roof leaked heavily on ac inner unit i got my panasonic ac installed 2 weeks ago, by a technician, assigned by panasonic. we needed a hole in the roof to pass the copper pipe, he mistakenly did a hole at wrong place, after that did a second one at correct place, but left the previous one open, instead just covered it with a flowerpot, and then, he and i both forgot about this one. this hole was positioned right above the ac inner unit. after the installation, i covered the second hole with cement, while the first hole remained as it is.

fast forward to today, it rained heavily in my city, i was out of my home for some work, when i got back, there was water all over in my room, and as expected, whole leakage was right above the ac unit. 

i was lucky, that in our city, the electricity goes out even if there's a slight weather change, and i have an mcb connected to my ac, which didn't go off, which means there was no short circuit.

i immediately cut the power supply of ac, covered it to prevent further water from falling on it, and then sealed the hole in the roof.

now i can't understand what do i do. is warranty void already? i have already raised a job request on the customer care, but they won't respond anytime soon. i can't dry it with a hair dryer since i may damage it more.

how fucked up am i? is it gonna cost too much? does inner unit gets damaged by water?"

reddit,2024-07-20 12:42:07,"what is the “great indian dream” just like “the great american dream” [serious] i've been thinking a lot about what the ""great indian dream"" is, much like the ""great american dream."" which politician or government do you think has done the best work and given hope for our country?

how did europe rebuild itself and become developed post-ww2 while we seem to be stuck in the same place?

don't you ever stop and wonder where we are headed as a country, seemingly without a collective vision or dream? it's frustrating. many of us work hard, pay taxes, and in return, we get religious fanaticism,filthy streets, poor water quality, inconsistent electricity, pothole-ridden roads, corruption, lack of freedom and liberty, subpar public healthcare and education... the list goes on.

essentially, we work three months every year for the government and get all this in return. kudos to us.

**please don't say that the ""great indian dream"" is to leave the country.** not everyone can emigrate, and other countries are becoming more restrictive and facing backlash due to excessive immigration.

i think the real problem is us. we are the problem, not bjp, congress, or anyone else. we stopped demanding better. we stopped raising our voices for things that matter. activism in india is minimal, and even when it exists, the public doesn't care. we show up for world cup victory parades but not for civic issues.

changing governments doesn't change anything. corruption remains, potholes remain, air quality remains poor, idiotic policies persist, etc. when journalists or activists die, we stay silent. when people are jailed, we stay silent. when judges are compromised, we stay silent. when draconian laws are passed, we stay silent.

and if you say, ""bro, we have jobs, what do you expect?"" then our country is doomed because you are the ones paying most of the direct taxes and getting nothing in return. 

**expecting change to happen magically, waiting for a superhero to save us, is just like religious people hoping for divine intervention. reality is hard. our lives suck. visit a western country if you haven't, and you'll see how we are living in a third-world country.**

before anyone says ""the grass is always greener on the other side,"" remember, here, grass doesn't exist, only plastic filth does. yes, the usa has its problems, but coping by pointing out their flaws won't help us. we can't achieve what they have even in another 100 years at this rate.

wake up, smell the coffee, and watch cricket.

i have some ideas on how to increase public accountability. check out some of my previous posts for a glimpse, but i doubt many of you are serious.

let’s discuss this seriously and see if we can find some hope for a collective vision for our country."
reddit,2024-07-20 16:00:18,"bescom's ultra incompetent staff started at 1 pm when a monkey walked onto a single pole  transformer and promptly got shocked to death. registered a complaint on bescom app at 1.16 pm.

also i called the local linesman to inform of the same. he ok i will come there as soon as i can.

1.45 pm : no response from app staff or from local linesman. 

2.30: still no response from either. called the local lineman and he said that he is busy else where and will come in an hours time. 

2.50: lineman comes and removes dead monkey. 
3:00 : senior bescom employee comes to lord over the junior employees. he has no idea what patch work has been done by his juniors. 

3.15 : i ask the senior employee why are they doing such a shoddy job. he proceeds to loudly scream at me for ""interfering"" in their work. i told him as a bill paying citizen it is my right to ask you the questions.
 
3.20 he continues to scream at me and neighbour's watch man claiming we are hindering their progress. all we wanted to make clear was that a 11kv line should not be left carelessly and is a public safety issue. he asks me to get lost and instructs his junior employees to cut electricity for my house and adjoining houses for asking him to do his job. i pulled out my camera to record this lord give his threats. he says i need to take his permission to record him or his employees i told him that he needs to request that  i don't record him instead. that put him in his place. 

4.00 pm : still no electricity in my house. still waiting. 

4.45 : i walked into bescom office koramangala and told them i will sit here till electricity is restored to our road. within 10 minutes the power comes back and i leave their office. 


this happened in 3rd block koramangala. close to bda complex. we pay our bills in full 1 day after the bill comes to our doorstep. we do not take the free 200 units. what gives these failed rowdies the guts to speak to us citizens in such a way as to threaten disconnection because we pointed out some flaws in their shoddy cellotape work style ? 

unless ur relatives are some high ranking person your worm gets done but common citizens are forced to deal with such goons.
 bescom shame on you and your rowdy employees. every momth i fill at least 30 liters in my diesel generator thanks to their shoddy supply policy."

reddit,2024-07-23 19:26:32,"budget 2024: a superficial fix that favors the elite 
in the wake of finance minister nirmala sitharaman's recent budget announcement, it’s evident that while the budget ostensibly aims to address critical issues like rural development, employment, and infrastructure, it fundamentally misses the mark on tackling the deep-rooted economic inequalities and systemic exploitation entrenched in our capitalist framework. despite appearing to offer solutions, the budget ultimately serves to fortify existing power structures, benefiting corporate interests at the expense of the working class and marginalized communities.

one of the most talked-about changes is the increased tax on long-term and short-term capital gains. raising the tax on long-term gains to 12.5% and short-term gains to 20% is a superficial gesture. this modest increase does little to disrupt the vast fortunes amassed through financial markets. it’s a symbolic move that placates critics without significantly affecting the elite investors who continue to thrive in a system designed to favor their wealth accumulation over societal welfare.

the much-publicized $24 billion job creation plan is another area where the budget falls short. this plan relies heavily on market mechanisms and incentives for the formal sector, such as direct cash transfers to first-time job entrants and manufacturing job incentives. however, these measures offer temporary relief and fail to address the structural unemployment and underemployment plaguing the nation. they perpetuate a cycle of precarious work and low wages rather than creating sustainable, meaningful employment opportunities.

tax relief for start-ups, the middle class, and foreign corporates further underscores the budget’s capitalist bias. the abolition of the angel tax and the reduction of corporate tax for foreign companies from 40% to 35% clearly prioritize corporate interests over public welfare. these tax cuts are unlikely to result in significant job creation or economic benefits for the majority of indians, enriching a small, already privileged segment of society instead.

the financial support allocated to bjp’s regional allies in andhra pradesh and bihar is a transparent political move. it seeks to secure loyalty and support rather than addressing the genuine developmental needs of these regions. while infrastructure projects are necessary, the allocation of funds here is driven by political expediency, not a coherent and equitable development strategy.

moreover, the reduced budget deficit, heralded as a fiscal success, is achieved through a significant dividend payout from the central bank rather than any substantial economic policy shift. this approach underscores the government’s short-term fiscal management focus, prioritizing immediate appearances over long-term financial stability and social equity.

finally, maintaining the state-led capital expenditure on infrastructure at the same level as the interim budget reveals a lack of genuine commitment to transformative economic policies. although the focus has diversified to include areas like employment, small businesses, and social welfare, these efforts are insufficient in addressing the deep-seated inequalities and systemic issues within the indian economy.

in essence, while this budget makes some nods toward social welfare and employment, it fundamentally fails to challenge the capitalist structures that perpetuate inequality and exploitation. it reinforces the interests of the corporate elite and political allies, leaving the working class and marginalized communities to continue bearing the brunt of systemic injustices. a truly transformative budget would prioritize wealth redistribution, robust structural employment programs, and comprehensive social welfare systems, ensuring economic growth benefits all sections of society, not just the privileged few."

# tl;dr

the union budget for 2024-2025 reveals an overall increase in funds allocation for meity, mha, mib, and dot as compared to 2023-2024. the budget allocated to meity has witnessed the highest increase among these ministries – 32.56% over last year's – yet-to-be-formed data protection board and the indiaai mission gets funding for the first time however, rural digital literacy scheme pmgdisha gets no funding (for the second year in a row). although dot cut funding for usof by \~80% as compared to 2023-2024 budget, it increased funding for bharatnet by 70%. while the overall increase in budgetary allocations compared to last year may paint a positive picture, on deeper analysis we realise that the decline in fund allocation towards long-established schemes and projects as well as underutilisation of funds continue to be unaddressed issues and thus a cause of contention.

# introduction

in the final session of the 17th ls term, union finance minister, shrimati nirmala sitharaman, presented the union interim budget for the financial year (“**fy**”) 2024-2025. in the ongoing monsoon session, the union finance minister placed a new budget for the fy2024-2024 in both houses on july 23, 2024. the budgeted estimates (“**be**”) for the ministry of electronics and information technology (“**meity**”), ministry of home affairs (“**mha**”), ministry of information and broadcasting (“**mib**”), and department of telecommunications (“**dot**”) witnessed an overall increase of 15.98% in the 2024-25 union budget compared to 2023-2024 be. 

the budget allocated to meity has witnessed the highest increase (32.56%) among these ministries in comparison to the previous budget (2023-2024) and dot witnessed the second highest (14.7%). the budget for mha and mib got a 9.44% and 7.45% increase respectively. the increase in the be for this fiscal year from the revised estimates (“**re**”) of the previous year was also the highest for meity (52.11%). while dot and mha saw an increase of 13.79% and 9.44% respectively, mib witnessed a decrease of 2.41% since the re of 2023-2024.

table 1: total expenditure for meity, mib, dot, and mha (in rs. crores)

digital public infrastructure (“**dpi**”) was an area of focus for the government during the presentation of the union budget including the varying schemes aimed at farmers with the digital crop survey, agri-stack, and also the service sector with a proposal for the development of more dpi apps for businesses. however, it appears that dpi(s) found limited specific budgetary allocation even after being a point of focus in the economic survey released a day before the budget 2024-25. dpis have been attributed for the rise in technological engagement of indian citizens with more ministries introducing population-scale interactive technological platforms which are being clubbed under the common banner of dpi. we will soon release a detailed analysis of the economic survey 2023-2024 and the over-reliance on technology-centred tools such as ai and dpi within it.

# the ministry of electronics and information technology

the total budgetary allocation for meity in the budget for 2024-2025 is ₹21936.9 cr, which is a 32.57% increase from the previous financial year’s budget (be 2023-2024). the increase is even higher when compared to the re of 2023-2024, i.e., a year-on-year change of 52.11%. this is in contrast to the budgetary trends we witnessed in 2021, 2022 and 2023, where there was underutilisation of the budget. we appreciate the large overall increase in budgetary allocation to meity in fy 2024-2025 and hope to see these funds be directed towards infrastructure development aimed at increasing telecom and broadband connectivity, research and deep deliberation into emerging technologies, strengthening of citizen-centric fora and systems, and closing the digital divide.

table 2: budgetary allocations for specific items for meity

the most notable change in the budget for 2024-2025, which has direct implications for digital rights, has to be the allocation of ₹2 cr for the data protection board (“**dpb**”). after a long and arduous journey for data protection legislation, it is disappointing to see funding of a mere ₹2 cr for a regulatory body whose functioning will have a direct impact on the implementation of the digital personal data protection act (“**dpdpa**”), 2023, successful or otherwise. of this ₹2 crore, only ₹4 lahks is [\~reportedly\~](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-budget-2024-25-health-ministry-allocated-rs-90-958-crore-full-details-101721738915694.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) allocated for capital expenditure, which includes fixed assets such as the digital portal, and the rest (₹ 1.96 cr) is allocated for revenue expenditure (salaries, etc). since it is unclear when the dpb will become functional, it is difficult to ascertain whether the allocated budget is meant to  be utilised for the entire financial year or a part of it. either way, a minuscule amount of ₹4 lakhs for capital expenditure on dpb may prove to be insufficient for upskilling and training of the dpb members. in the following budgets, we hope meity ensures that it is adequately resourced for the institutional preparation of the dpb. adequate funding for key regulatory bodies such as the dpb will contribute to its independent functioning which is necessary to keep checks and balances on the executive. 

allocation towards a prominent regulatory body essential for the cybersecurity health of the country, the indian computer emergency response team (“**cert-in**”) also increased by 5.78% from the previous year’s budget. on another positive note, funding allocated to ‘cyber security projects’ has seen a massive increase of 89.75% since last year. this substantial increase in allocation was much needed in the backdrop of increasing incidents of data breaches and vulnerabilities and the absence of an operational, robust, and rights-advancing data protection legislation. [\~recent\~](https://internetfreedom.in/cybersecurity-report-for-q2-2024/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) grave cybersecurity incidents, like the tamil nadu police facial recognition portal breach and the telangana police network data leak, have raised concerns about the detection and response capabilities of india’s cybersecurity authorities. it is worth noting that meity utilised only ₹30.11 cr out of the allocated ₹300 cr in 2022-2023, despite persisting challenges of insufficient resources, outdated infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled professionals. we hope that the same trend of under-utilisation is not followed by the ministry this fiscal year and ahead.

another introduction this year was the addition of ‘indiaai mission’ as a central sector scheme, with a notable allocation of ₹551.75 cr. this is on top of the infusion of ₹10,371.92 cr [\~approved\~](https://pib.gov.in/pressreleaseiframepage.aspx?prid=2012355&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in) by the previous national democratic alliance (“**nda**”) cabinet in march 2024 which is to be disbursed over a period of five years to establish the scheme including its compute capacity program. the program [\~aims\~](https://pib.gov.in/pressreleaseiframepage.aspx?prid=2012355&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to establish a 10,000 graphics processing unit infrastructure to be built with public-private partnerships. the working group appointed by the government on indiaai in its october 2023 [\~report\~](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/indiaai-expert-group-report-first-edition.pdf?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) had recommended at least 24,500 graphics processing units for infrastructural requirements. moreover, the increased focus on ai and massive budgetary allowances form cause for concern owing to the massive effects of the technology on the climate – with a single chatgpt search taking 10 times as much energy as a regular google search, according to the [\~economic survey 2023-24\~](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/index.php?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). the survey cautioned against artificial intelligence’s impact not only on climate but also on employment opportunities amidst rising automation in industries making employees redundant. with increasing trends of techno-solutionism plaguing governance in india, increased budgetary focus on bolstering ai capabilities may result in more unnecessary technological interventions – but now with ai.

disappointingly, the budget for 2023-2024 and the interim budget for 2024-2025 for meity did not allocate any funds to pradhan mantri gramin digital saksharta abhiyan (“**pmgdisha**”), breaking the trend of continuous budgetary support for the rural digital literacy scheme since its inception in 2017. pmgdisha was key to increased connectivity, telecom penetration, and digital literacy across india. allocations to the scheme touched an all-time low in 2022 since 2017, and then last year in the fy 2023-24 budget, no funds were allocated towards it. the last impact assessment study of pmgdisha was carried out by the indian institute of public administration in 2020-21. the report [\~concluded\~](https://pib.gov.in/pressreleaseiframepage.aspx?prid=1843061&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in) that the scheme, as a digital literacy programme, “*plays an indispensable part in not only bridging the digital gap in the country but also transforming it into a knowledge economy and society*.” the allocations made to this scheme must increase, and more importantly exist, to ensure its effective progress and robust digital literacy in the country.

figure 1: budget allocation to pmgdisha (meity)

the other interesting trend is the complete discontinuation of budgetary allocation towards ‘promotion of digital payments’ under meity’s budget for this year. last year, we noted that the allocation to this domain plummeted to ₹1500 cr as compared to ₹2137 cr allocated to it in the 2022-2023 re, reflecting a decline of 29.8%. in the re of 2023-2024, the allocation was further reduced to ₹584 cr and finally to 0 in the budget for 2024-2025. it is also interesting to note that revised allocations increased sharply in 2022-2023 (₹2137 cr), witnessing a jump of 968.5% as compared to the 2022-2023 be which stood at ₹200 crores. even though the allocation in 2023-2024 is higher than the 2022 be, it stood lower than the re. 

https://preview.redd.it/ybiiuvbehled1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01176f7ed7571b9e35b7c3e17cf81973bfa19e95

figure 2: budgetary allocation to ‘promotion of digital payments’ (meity)

meity has introduced an item titled ‘promotion of digital transactions (excluding digital payments)’ under the digital india program, for which it has allocated ₹1.5 cr. as per meity, the objective of this scheme is to promote overall digitisation for the efficient delivery of citizen-centric services and empowerment of citizens. through this newly introduced item, meity hopes to grow the volume of digital transactions in the country. it also believes that this expenditure may have a cascading effect on the promotion of digital payments scheme including estimating and measuring digital economy of india, suggesting a measurement framework for such estimation, and providing suitable policy recommendations for boosting the size and growth of the digital economy in india by leveraging the digital technologies. interestingly, despite this new addition, the total expenditure towards the digital india program has reduced significantly and consistently since the be for 2022-2023.

# the ministry of home affairs

the total budgetary allocation for mha is 9.44% higher than what was allocated in the be for 2023-24 and 9.44% higher than the 2023-2024 revised budget. the allocation in the budget estimates, net of receipts and recoveries, for mha is ₹6458.24 cr. the allocation for planned capital expenditure has marginally dipped as compared to both 2023-2024 be (by 10.16%) and re (by 29.39%), which is disappointing.

table 3: budgetary allocations for specific items for mha

additionally, we notice an interesting trend in allocations to the item ‘census, survey and statistics/ registrar general of india’. for the past few years, the estimated budget for surveys and census has been large, but the actual utilisation remains minuscule. the biggest dip was seen in 2022-23, where the budget allocated was ₹3676 cr, but only ₹513.18 cr was utilised. for be 2024-25, the allocation remains large, but it is likely to fall into the same pattern of remaining underutilised

figure 4: budgetary allocation to census, survey and statistics/registrar general of india (mha)

on a disappointing note, mha did not allocate any funds towards its [\~cyber and information security\~](https://www.mha.gov.in/en/divisionofmha/cyber-and-information-security-cis-division?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) (“**c&amp;is**”) division, which includes key schemes such as the cybercrime prevention against women and children scheme and the indian cybercrime coordination centre (“**i4c**”) scheme. [\~reportedly\~](https://theprint.in/economy/budget-2024-mha-gets-rs-2-19-lakh-crore-focus-on-training-and-research-big-boost-for-ib-cisf/2187805/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), i4c didn’t get fresh funding this year because it “*ceased to exist as a union government scheme starting 1 july and began working as part of the mha*”. interestingly, other divisions of the mha such as the freedom fighters and rehabilitation division and the police division still got funding allocated to them. from a reading of the budget, it is unclear under which item, if at all, is mha allocating funds for cyber security and awareness efforts. earlier this year, i4c was [\~notified\~](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/govt-designates-i4c-as-agency-of-mha-to-notify-unlawful-activities-in-cyber-world/articleshow/108501675.cms?from=mdr&amp;ref=static.internetfreedom.in) as the official agency by mha to notify law enforcement authorities, under the information technology act, 2000, about unlawful activities in the cyberspace. additionally, funding for a special wing of ""cyber commandos"", reportedly an mha project meant to tackle cyber threats along with local administration, is also missing from this year’s budget for mha, despite [\~expectations\~](https://www.business-standard.com/budget/news/budget-special-unit-of-cyber-commandos-on-home-ministry-s-100-day-agenda-124062100754_1.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in).

# the ministry of information and broadcasting

the total budgetary allocation for mib in 2024-25 is ₹4342.55 cr, which is a 7.45% decrease from the 2023-2024 budget and a 2.41% decrease from the 2023-2024 revised budget. this cut comes after mib seemingly was able to utilise a higher budget allocation last year, which seems incongruent. interestingly, the total budgetary allocation for fy 2024-2025 is the same as the allocation under the interim budget for 2024-2025, a trend uncommon for several other ministries. 

https://preview.redd.it/uumo8ingkled1.png?width=656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01047f19263b763a7e3b4810d6ed10b8db6225d6

table 4: budgetary allocations for specific items for mha

mib’s total ae since 2014-2015 has been relatively stable, as compared to the ae of meity, mha, and dot. notably, dot has introduced funding for the establishment of the ‘bhartiya bhasha anubhag’ scheme, which is a platform meant to facilitate the translation of various languages into hindi and vice versa. 

# the department of telecommunications

in 2024-25, dot (which operates under the ministry of communications) has been allocated ₹111915.43 cr, which is a 14.69% increase over the budget allocated in 2023-24 (₹97579.05 cr) and 13.78% over the re for 2023-24 (₹98359.41 cr).

table 4: budgetary allocations for specific items for dot

surprisingly, the universal services obligation fund (“usof”) took a hit in funds with only ₹2000 cr allocated to it in the 2024-25 budget (same as last year’s re), an 80.77% fall from last year’s ₹10400 cr. telecom services providers have [\~persistently\~](https://www.business-standard.com/budget/news/budget-wish-list-telecom-industry-calls-for-junking-usof-slashing-duties-124011800938_1.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) urged the ministry of finance to suspend usof till the existing corpus is exhausted, and in their budget requests for 2024-25, pressed for an exemption from the service tax on “assignment of right to use natural resources” and the slashing of customs duty on telecom equipment to zero. allocation to ‘compensation to telecom service providers’ saw a 102% increase in the 2024-2025 budget (₹10100 cr) as compared to the 2023-2024 budget (₹5000 cr). this item is meant to provide for the “*creation and augmentation of telecom infrastructure and access to various telecom services to people in the rural and remote areas including operation and maintenance of village public telephones*.”

as far as allocations for bharatnet are concerned, there has been a significant increase of 70% in be 2024-25 (₹8500 cr) from be 2023-24 (₹5000 cr). the grant goes towards the creation of telecom infrastructure required for providing broadband connectivity to all the gram panchayats in the country and facilitating non-discriminatory access to service providers, for provisioning of broadband services in rural areas. the sharp increase in budget is appreciated.

total budgetary allocation for regulatory bodies such as the telecom regulatory authority of india (“**trai**”) and telecom disputes settlement and appellate tribunal has seen a significant dip this year (₹113 cr) as compared to the previous year (₹238.53 cr). the funding for trai has reduced by 48.68% over the past year, even though dot utilised the entire revised amount allocated in 2022-2023 for the regulatory body, which was more than the be for 2022-2023.

although dot allocated ₹50,00,000 towards ‘artificial intelligence and face recognition powered solution for telecom sim subscriber verification (astr)’ in the 2023-2024 budget, it has not allocated any funding in the 2024-2025 budget. funding for the digital intelligence unit project, which is meant to investigate fraudulent activity involving telecom resources, such as unsolicited commercial communication, witnessed a drastic reduction of 61.36% in the 2024-2025 budget (₹85 cr) as compared to the previous budget (₹220 cr). dot has also allocated ₹38.76 cr for the first time for the ‘prevention of spoofed incoming international calls system – 'cior' (centralized international out roamer)’.

# conclusion

the 2024-25 budget leaves us with a variety of feelings, some of hope and some of disappointment. while there are some budgetary allocations made for the first time, like the dpb, indiaai mission, and ‘promotion of digital transactions’, long-established budgetary items such as the ‘promotion of digital payments’, pmgdisha, the census, i4c, and the usof either witnessed a complete discontinuation of funds or took a significant hit in the allocated funds. overall funding towards the dpb includes planned capital expenditure of only ₹4 lakhs which is inadequate to say the least. an additional cause for concern is the decrease in the ae as compared to the re, and in the re as compared to the be, for the last few years. the re indicates how much is possible for the government to extend to the concerned sector and the ae indicates how much was extended. while some variation among the three is inevitable, too much of a difference can [\~reduce\~](https://www.indiaspend.com/budget/be-re-or-actuals-what-do-you-need-to-look-at-in-the-upcoming-budget-800937?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) the credibility of the numbers and cause uncertainty. cuts in and underutilisation of the re may also negatively affect the implementation of government schemes and projects. in light of the increasing digitisation across sectors and the increasing demand for improved digital literacy as well as access to digital services, we hope that the fund allocation in these concerned sectors continues to witness a positive trend. although we appreciate the overall increase in be this year as compared to last year, we hope to see these funds be utilised efficiently and directed towards infrastructure development aimed at increasing tele-connectivity, broadband connectivity, cybersecurity, and overall digital literacy."

reddit,2024-07-26 17:42:50,"what happened to people who said they’re voting for dictatorship and infrastructure? its quite funny and sad at the same time to see bjp bhakts and ardent supporters fuming over the recent budget.

these people were the ones who said no problem even if inflation skyrockets , we will vote for modiji, even if fuel prices hit 500₹ / litre and a cylinder costs 5000₹..

what ever happened to the ultra nationalistic sentiment and pride these people chided in? what happened to people who said they’re voting for dictatorship and infrastructure? where are they?

why don’t they want to contribute to vikasit bharat? 

why are they unhappy in ram rajya?

why are they not content with their taxes being used to build international infrastructure and smart cities like that of pragati maidan, bharat mandapam, mumbai, delhi, ayodhya, airports and the engineering marvels of bridges in bihar, the engineering marvels of railway tracks and railways that they collide or go off track

arent they anti-nationals? and anyone who echoed slight criticism was rapidly and ruthlessly attacked and labelled anti-nationals.

**they deserve every bit of it and more but unfortunately cannot wish for it because in their quest towards strongman cultish dictatorship they will take everything and everyone down with them.**

oh the irony that if congress came to power they will raise taxes, bring in inheritance tax, take away your buffaloes, water taps, gold, flats etc, was the rhetoric during the election campaign

and lets remember, among bjp’s strong supporters are those urban class voters in large numbers too.

now someone in the comments will still have the audacity to say congress is worse, there is no alternative, and still believe in the false myths propagated by bjp about congress in general and its manifesto and etc etc.
 
i wont really spend time trying to combat your false myths about congress etc because its you have drank too much of bjp’s vikasit bharat and ultranationalistic pride akin to drinking magability kool-aid in the us. there’s a reason why such people are called andhbhakts.

if youre upset with the current tax raj, read up on congress’s manifesto on what they had proposed and you’ll find what you wish for now but unfortunately wont happen atleast for a few years or until the govt changes..*(i have tooo little hopes that those govt listens to feedback and outrage and protests and mend their ways or rollback certain proposals)*

and yes, congress has a ton of problems too, but ultimately its the lesser of two evils in politics unfortunately.

will write up criticism sometime soon about congress too. 

**the harsh truth is that the party that alleged what the congress led alliance would do, had they come to power, has itself done all those things,all while keeping people distracted from the main issues**"

reddit,2024-07-29 00:46:59,"what are some good things about living in indian cities? i am a 30-year-old male living in bangalore and working in an it firm. originally from a small town in north india, i am acutely aware of the numerous issues plaguing indian cities. overpopulation, high taxes, inadequate government services, severe inflation, subpar govt schools, poor infrastructure, insufficient healthcare, a lack of basic civic sense in people, communal tensions, extreme religious sentiments, crime, pollution, unemployment, and corrupt politicians are just a few of the challenges we face.

these issues have increasingly filled me with anger, affecting my daily mood, health, and relationships. the traffic and the sight of people disregarding basic rules infuriate me. i spend a lot of time watching foreign vlogs, creating an alternate reality to escape from my frustrations. this only intensifies my anger, as i see the common sense exhibited in other countries, which seems lacking here. everything about living in an indian city now triggers me. every pothole on the road, every politician, every government school, and the condition of the railways—everything triggers me now.

i don't have the option to move abroad due to family reasons, but i am desperate to escape this perpetual state of anger. it's taking a significant toll on me. i don't want to rely on foreign vlogs and videos as a temporary escape; it feels like a cheap dopamine fix that only exacerbates my frustration.

is there a way to overcome this? am i perhaps too ignorant of my country, overlooking its positives? one option might be to avoid living in big indian cities and move to smaller towns, but let's assume my job doesn't allow that. and it seems like a temporary fix because i will be part of same country.

what should i do? is there any way to not feel this angry all the time?"

reddit,2024-07-31 13:34:50,"broadcasting bill is coming and content creators need your help! hellos,

if you are a content creator, commentator or journalist on twitter, instagram or youtube, it is very likely that the broadcasting bill is going to affect you massively. if you are a casual viewer or user of any social media plaform, the incoming bill has a provision to declare you as a broadcaster if they feel your content falls into the vague &amp; broad criteria of broadcaster.

we have a vague idea of how they are defining broadcasters, but we don't know for sure. all because ashwini vaishnav's ministry has not made the current draft of the bill public.

so some of us creators have gotten together to write a letter, asking him to make the bill public.

the idea is simple: as creators &amp; content consumers, we are stakeholders and we need to know what the government is doing to 'regulate' our content.

here is the letter: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fyocms2p7s0dtuiernfpj-khwv74nhf7/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fyocms2p7s0dtuiernfpj-khwv74nhf7/view)

if you are a creator and/or stakeholder, please fill this form if you agree &amp; to endorse this letter: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlsecw\_bdtbishe9upqzbnjnztsvx8ab7t\_szl532ccgr2ce6oq/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlsecw_bdtbishe9upqzbnjnztsvx8ab7t_szl532ccgr2ce6oq/viewform)

please do share this with any other content creators who you think would be affected by this. as citizens of the internet, we need to unite because this is a question of our livelihoods.

tl;dr - modi 240 govt is bringing in a garbage bill to ""regulate"" dissenters on the internet, censor uncomfortable content &amp; shut down anti-government narratives. help us find out how by telling ashwini vaishnav to reveal the bill. and share this form with content creators who you think would help put pressure on them.

regards,

reddit,2024-08-01 23:36:46,"we need more people being open and sharing valuable insight from their profession and educated other it’s like we(india) have become educated robots producing machine but they don’t pay us we pay them to go there and once our children are born there we are no more indian. 

we indian love slaves. for use it is once an employee always an employee. we don’t see other people hard work and the torture they have been through to change their self and mind you change is tough pill to swallow. 

indian are very bad at everything( i hate my self for this) we have world class specs to ignore like garbage and benefiting hobbies and many more and the main problems is again slavery you don’t give poor money rich don’t give middle class money and this cycle will always continue. 

i am a muslim but this caste system is still running in our blood we all love to judge. what’s your percentage? what do you do for living? we should never judge person but if you know he is weak you should be he older brother and keep guiding him where and how you learn thing to be better off this world and how to learn that 

“how to learn” one how the most important things to teach other. you guide and immature person but never guide a mature person please. teach him how he can do it, let him do it and see if he can do it don’t judge him there too. i want to be entrepreneur, i want to open factory or i want business which can be opened for minimum and can be large scale business but no one will tell you how you can do it even if they have some insight they will say oh this oh that.

youtube shorts and reels are just destroying you all. always think you are paying some random vlogger or uneducated rat money who will never even take a selfie with you and note this down a selfie is nothing but a prove of you wasted time so much time for least dominant person (i don’t know how to explain that). you could have praised someone who is showing you knowledge and i also get it being a youtube is a skill and the name of the game is how can hook you up they most professional people don’t have time for hooking you up . 


there are still 1000more problem i can share(maybe i will write more) but we need each other. your friend are not the close one your family is not the close one. your india is not the close one. your world is not the close one. the real close one is there person who want to learn your expertise or experience. you can’t teach anyone who doesn’t want to you can only give a opinion that’s all"

reddit,2024-08-04 20:47:12,"a tragedy waiting to happen an establishment in kalyan nagar called tositos has decided that advertising for their business transcends the need for safety for pedestrians. they have blocked an entire pavement leaving a small wedge where people have to squeeze under an electric wire. 
so it’s a choice between risking your life by getting electrocuted or walk in traffic. 
what goes on in their single-celled brain when they do ridiculous things like this?

edit:
i raised the complaint [here](https://banaswadi.in)

it is a repository of all things related to the government. you can raise requests for street lights not working, garbage not getting collected etc. among other things. it’s mostly for banaswadi and surrounding areas, but there’s some stuff which non banaswadi people can use also. 

hope it helps you all."

reddit,2024-08-05 22:55:25,"what could be done to fix the healthcare system of this country so everyone regardless of money or connections gets the care that they need?  plain and simple, what could be done to fix this. firstly, in delhi where i'm from, in upper middle class and rich circles there's a free floating opinion surrounding doctors and nurses in government hospitals being incompetent and they got these jobs through reservations, they're not the best educated to treat you etc. secondly, there is again in upper middle class and rich circles - this free floating opinion that doctors and nurses in government hospitals use all kinds of unsanitory practices like using the same syringe on multiple patients and there is filth everywhere and massive cleanliness related issues etc. now, this is something that i could really vouch for as i've seen this thing through my own eyes- i reside in west delhi and ddu hospital in hari nagar is the closest one to my residence. one night i suffered a severe panic attack that couldn't just be cured by taking deep breaths and drinking water. i literally felt my heart will explode out of my body because my heart beat was racing so high. finally, i decided to go to the emergency in ddu hospital and what i saw was a street dog moving from one emergency room to the other and on his paws were the stains of someone's blood (probably came from someone's accident) and nobody paid the slightest attention to it. watching this horror show, i just decided to go to the local pharmacy and bought an anti anxiety medication to calm myself. on top of that, there are extremely long queues, no proper cleaning and no proper sanitary practices like putting on medical gloves while treating someone -  there horrible things are something that i've witnessed with my own eyes. 

now, someone may say - well the hospital you went to had problems, it's not all government hospitals and to counter that argument, a couple of months back i went to donate blood for someone who at that time was admitted in aiims delhi. now, aiims delhi is often times regarded as not only the best government hospital but the best hospital in general in whole of india. now, to their credit, i didn't notice any unsanitory practices in aiims but what i saw were people all over the place sitting outside of waiting rooms, ers, icus on the floor. a hospital like aiims is the last place that anyone would prefer to sit on the floor. on top of that, typical government corruption by having links with doctors or admin staff would enable you to see the doctor in no time. this was the reality i witnessed. 

now, a single payer healthcare system like nhs or the one that canada has would be extremely benifical except all of its horrible waiting times. and frankly speaking, anyone with a decent amount of money would anyday prefer to get themselves treated in a private hospital. 

my question is - how to fix all of this. i know we have a massive shortage of doctors. our government should incentivise the profession of becoming a doctor or nurse to young girls and boys by providing competitive salaries and good work life balance. there is again a massive shortage of medical schools to address the massive deficiency of qualified doctors and nurses. not only this, the administrative staff is so understaffed in these hospitals resulting in long long queues just to get an appointment receipt. we have the world's biggest population of young people, all we need is the way to address our doctor and nurse shortage issue by making medical schools affordable for anyone who wants to become a doctor or nurse, cutting down on excessive bureaucracy and again making these professions lucrative even for doctors and nurses that are in govt hospitals across different parts of india. and here we are dealing with government corruption scandals and examination cheating in the neet exam in 2024. why would anyone want to become a doctor or a nurse in this country when the whole system is riddled with unimaginable levels of corruption and all the odds are stacked against you.

at the end of the day, i don't really blame the doctor for the things i've seen because a doctor could only do this much. it is physically and mentally impossible for a doctor to see more than 100 patients a day. what we need is an enormous amount of money injected in the healthcare sector to build government hospitals, nursing care units, medical schools etc. and establish sound guidelines and rules for different medical practices but also make sure to properly enforce them. 

i've also read on different subs that doctors have to literally pay in many cases to get a job at a government hospital. now, that is absolutely shameful and hard to imagine - a sector where india has a massive job deficiency, people are buying their way in govt hospitals to get jobs. so this corruption has to be eradicated. 

these are my thoughts on fixing the abysmal condition of our healthcare system where rich are thriving and going to private hospitals but middle class and poor are left to rot in long long queues with inexplicably high waiting times in government hospitals. maybe we can adopt a system similar to singapore as i've heard and read online that the system is pretty good when it comes to providing care for all citizens but also cuts down on waiting times - something which is a big drawback in single payer healthcare systems. 

anyways, please share your thoughts. i'm not sure if there are people on this sub that are actual doctors or nurses or any other kind of medical professional or industry insider or even a current medical student or neet aspirant thinking on becoming a doctor in the future - your opinions and thoughts on how to fix the healthcare system of this country (which unfortunately right now is in an abysmal condition) would be deeply appreciated.."

reddit,2024-08-09 00:02:24,"sorry to say but being born as an indian in this world really feels like a massive curse !!  not to sound self - racist, but everywhere i see is desperation. people trying to leave shitty abhorrent and unlivable living conditions of our country. and if you say something publicly, get ready to either get shot in the head by the goons and henchmen of your local politician or religious cult mafia or get ready because a mob will kidnap you and lynch you and even make a full video whopping your ass and no fucking thing will happen to them. 

justice system is a joke, infrastructure is a joke, poverty levels are unimaginable, population is exploding like rabbits, over to over crowded cities, little to no jobs and even those jobs are no real quality jobs, garbage all over, dogs and cows and cats walking on the roads blocking the traffic and pooping on the road - everything accepted because that's our religion. if you try to remove cows or dogs get ready to be murdered in plain sight and don't expect any justice. absolutely deplorable, shitty and abhorrent living conditions, traffic all over, worst air quality on the emtire planet, no clean drinking water, potholes all over, no good public education or even healthcare (coming from someone who recently visited aiims - where standing up in the queues of 200 people and sitting in the hospital for 8 straight hours will already make your medical condition from bad to worse ), no regard of civic sense whatsoever, theocracy, age old traditions that are purely superstitions and not compatible in a modern 21st century society - the list goes on and on and on. 

now, when you take a leap of faith and figure out a way to leave this country as a student or working professional, firstly you're not given visas in a large number of cases because people judge you and susspect that you'll not return back on your student visa, in the unlikely event you even get a visa, you're now competing with other indians for visa lotteries. and indians being indians are commiting all kinds of scams to be able to get their visas or somehow prolong their period of stay. 

everywhere you go you're looked down upon. you're made to stand in long queues while some other fucker from a rich country will take his baggage and leave with no waiting. people will look at you with suspicion while some other rich fucker will walk freely because why would a person who lives in a developed country commit any kind of immigration scam. our own people are spitting on us and people from other backgrounds, countries and ethnicites are spitting on us. 

here's an indian, one in 1.5 billion - no individual value of our own - please stay back. 

all i see is misery. even asked folks from the mba sub on how the job situation is for internationals. they said it is tough for us as us citizens but for internationals - you're literally in the worst demographic of being an indian because your chances of getting h1b are minimum and no company will give $15k for you. 

i also get mad at some of these youtubers, vloggers, bloggers who are basically our beloved nris who reside in the us but makes videos about how great india is or how fast india is developing or gow india is going to be the next superpower. if there is an award for epitome of hypocrisy then that award has to be given to these assholes. bitch you left india for the us to now dump on the us and pretend india is growing to make some quick buck on youtube. if india is so fucking great, live here, work here, travel on pothole filled roads, go to office in a crowded bus or metro or dmu train just like millions of people do and then go on and psuedo praise india. you left india becuse of abject poverty, becuase of terrible labour laws, because your daughter felt unsafe, because your kids had no future, because you want to breathe breathable air, becuase of upward social mobility, because of your skill and talent recognition in the foreign country, because of clean environment not filled with garbage, because of livable cities, becuase of employment and business opportunities, because you got one life and you didn't want to waste in this third world hellhole. 

call me a ranter, self - racist, india hater - use all kinds of monikers to describe me but atleast i'm honest about it. i don't self censor my rants on reddit unlike censoring my mouth in public which has far more serious consequences. i'm not a two faced, double crossed, us loving from inside but pretending to love india from outside, ignorant piece of shit like all these so called vloggers and content creators who reap the benifits of western society but play with the sentiments and dumbness of illiterate indians who love watching an nri praise how good india is. 

then some of these cold farts try to say - india has landed on moon, look at how incredibly successful indian americans are, look at all the ceos of these tech companies - same old gossip bla bla bla. if anyone hasn't said it yet, then i'll say it. these are individual achievements and not collective achievements. if india landed on the moon, that's because of the incredibly smart and talented team of scientists, engineers and technicians who managed to pull off this endeavour on a shoestring budget. similarly, ceos of companies are made based on their personal performance and track record in a company not because they are indians. ofcourse, if the barrier to entry is so goddamm high for indians in america, then you'll obviously you'll get the best of the very best - scientists, engineers, business leaders, finance professionals, doctors etc etc. if you want to see what happens if you let all indians in - then go north and look at canada. how big of a shitholy mess it has become and the exact same fate will happen to us if they let all kinds of people in. all in all this is to say, it is the achievements of a few that are dillusional psychotards are pretending to brag about. similarly, i don't see every gora or white person as smart. sure, so many innovations came from the west but those were individual achievements not because every white person is inherently smart. einstein was smart, newton was smart, alexandra graham bell was smart that doesn't mean you're average white joe from suburban lousiana who works at his father's grocery is also smart to be able to invent something. please don't capitalise on the achievements of other folks. it's disrespectful for not only you but it's equally demonizing for them.. 


as for me, i'm convinced that being born in this country and calling yourself as an indian in today's world is one of the biggest curses if not the biggest. 


this was my mini rant. 


edit: for everyone who has commented - go to pakistan, somalia, bangladesh, yemen, syria, north korea, gaza etc. - countries that are failed states ravaged with poverty, terrorism, civil war, brutal dictatorship etc. - please don't misunderstand my post. i'm forever grateful for the fact that i'm not born in those countries where everyday literally is survival between life and death. hunger, terrorists blowing themselves all over the place, missiles bombing the shit out of your country etc etc. - these are unimaginably pathetic conditions to think about let alone live in. my rant was about - how this country could do way better but nothing gets done. failed education and underfunded healthcare systems, one of the lowest passport rankings in the world, terrible unemployment, wealth inequality like you've never seen, worst air quality and garbage all over etc. it is an inherent tendency of human beings to upgrade themselves. that's why we study, work hard, switch jobs - to get more money to upgrade our standard of living. you only compare yourself with other nations that are richer than you, have better infrastructure than you, have less societal problems than you - to see where you lack and what you can do better. the problem is our politicians, culture and society despite knowing everything they are willfully letting us stay back to fulfill their own agenda. politicians and some so-called influencers like elvish yadav play with the dumbness of their audience to pretend - we are kattar hindus. while they don't remotely practise any good thing that hinduism says. 

the plain fact is - democracy could only thrive in countries where people are educated enough to make rational choices about who will lead them. unfortunately, that's not the case with india. that's why i've also always promulgated this notion - quality matters not quantity. if a 1000 people say the same old dumb shit, that doesn't make it right even if 1000 people are saying it. looking down on countries that are failed states will only give you a false sense of encouragement but looking up will actually make you realise how far we've fallen and how behind we are than the rest of the developed world. people are leaving in droves and nothing gets affected. why do our knucklehead leaders don't realize that the educated people of your country are leaving. you instead of fixing the fundamental problems in your own country are actively encouraging them to leave because they will act like a cash cow in the form of remittances. plain and simple there is no regard for a common man's life in this country and that's why people leave and will continue to leave at higher rates. as for my own thinking, i don't believe in any reincarnation - i'm sorry. i've got one life and i want to live it in a cleaner world, with proper rules of law, where your skills and hard work are rewarded, where there is clean environment, where there is no overcrowding of cities, where there are no negative ramifications of criticising your own culture or religion or expressing your dissident towards government. reddit i assume is a safe place for now because you're anonymous but if i said all of this in public - you all know my head at this point would have been hanging on a tree. plain and simple. it's your life and you get to decide how you want to live it. not saying it's all beds and roses in foreign countries, but at least there is justice, there is social mobility, there is clean environment, there is breathable air, there are balanced populated cities, there is freedom of speech to spill out truth not only on reddit or 4chan but in the public too without the fear of getting shot or lynched by people who'll never spent a night in jail. hopefully you guys are able to understand where i'm coming from. 

and i do wanna apologize if i just got carried away with this rant and said things in a way that was heinously offensive. 


edit 2: for all the people who found my post extremely offensive or think that i'm entitled and that's not the way you shame your nation, i humbly apologize to all of you and say sorry. hurting anybody's sentiments or patriotism in any way, shape or form was never my intention. in all honesty, i do suffer from mental illness ( chronic depression and anxiety ) and when i get these bouts of depressive episodes ( usually at night ) - all i see is pessimism or negativity and the only way i could express my anger and frustration and depressive thoughts is by going on reddit and letting my anger out. please accept this as a formal apology from me. not trying to defend what i wrote in this post by saying i'm depressed and not doing good mentally, but what i wrote was all that was popping in my head last night. again, sorry if this hurts you in any way, shape or form. i'm currently seeking treatment from aiims delhi and hope that i recuperate from this as early as possible."

reddit,2024-08-09 15:10:58,"exposed: how a 5-star real estate project turned into a horror story hey, reddit fam, we need some serious advice/help here!

we invested in what we thought was a dream project – two 3 bhk apartments (3011 &amp; 3081) in [leela residences at bhartiya city, bangalore](https://imgur.com/a/oecuwtv), managed by the reputed leela hotels. but what we’ve experienced is nothing short of a horror story. even nearly three years after oc from bbmp (bangalore's municipal authority), from non-existent electricity connections (yes, the building is running on borrowed electricity from leela hotel) to falling ceilings, incomplete amenities and endless legal battles, we're at our wits' end. the authorities are either oblivious or complicit.

our lawyer thoroughly checked the documents including the occupancy certificate (oc) before investing but the oc itself turned out to be misleading. do we trust these govt. issued documents, or do we need to investigate even the government documents? in any case, here's our rant!

# background

* developer: bhartiya urban private limited
* location: bhartiya city, thanisandra, north bangalore (125-acre project)
* project: leela residences – 176 apartments managed by leela hotels
* attractions: managed by leela hotels and [claimed to be living in your own 5-star hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t10civq5jdk&amp;t=425s). additionally, a mall and multiplex are in the same compound.
* this property's [oc was issued in january 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11iqegumcvah0qemihugrgje4ialiusfg/view), so it's been close to 3 years. (oc is issued after the project is completed and ready for occupation!). read below with that context in mind.

# our nightmare

even though none of these issues (in isolation) is severe, they are cumulative, and we failed to convince the authorities or the developer to address them.

* electricity woes: no bescom connection for two years! we've been running on hotel power and generators. frequent power trips and appliance damage are regular occurrences. our [electricity bill is issued on leela hotels letterhead](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dlfacix5iysrfftyho3p5fs7fpty5q-s/view) with an illegal 18% gst. bbmp knows but ignores!
* access road issues: a 125-acre development does not have a proper road. the main road (is private property) and the other is a narrow back road through a village (which is also apparently under litigation). we have yet to digest how the developer hid something so fundamental, if not trying to cheat. there are ig posts/videos (search ""namma bangalore bhartiya mall trespassers"" on google) and [another reddit post](https://op.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/11zr2q0/land_owner_holds_township_ransom/) on this topic. how did the authorities permit such a project?
* dropping ceilings: on dec 31, 2023, a roof section collapsed from ten floors above and fell on the mall's pavement. see these pictures: [one](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lhmfllwf__7audwqkcauydy9g2zml4oc) and [two](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lhmfllwf__7audwqkcauydy9g2zml4oc). a couple escaped by a split second.
* incomplete construction: despite having an occupancy certificate (which means everything is completed) that is three years old, the [penthouses in tower b are under construction as of august 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0f60by5bg0), and this is the [condition of the clubhouse as of august 2024](https://youtu.be/rgrwyzywdmg). even the building facade is incomplete after three years ([incomplete](https://imgur.com/a/5ldze07) photo and [completed look](https://imgur.com/a/o2hm5m1)). what exactly is bbmp doing?
* lifts: the lifts stop working when it rains. there were two incidents where the lift had free fall of 1-2 floors. even as of 9/8/24 the lifts in tower b stopped working - reasons aside, such occurrences are way too frequent. hearsay: the developer is skimping by not paying for something as basic an amc for lifts.
* waterlogging: these were our lobbies (managed by leela hotels!) when the rainwater[ flooded the residences](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hmswma3phhs) (a few months back).
* park lies: the advertised 7-acre park has shrunk to less than half, with new office buildings encroaching. the brochure clearly states 7 acres; even on 08/08/24, [google results show the same](https://imgur.com/loqo0hj). all marketing says, ""7 acre park"" and the developer just mentioned ""park"" in the agreement. are we screwed?
* shoddy materials: windows that leak air and water (agreement promises double-glazed but worse than locally made), patched-up marble floors ([promised](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zlrmuvm7-fkjl42ogcoh7ndw55nvhl36/view?usp=drive_link) vs [actual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lnlih3ori1wqvjjki5toel3gyf3qtcos/view?usp=drive_link)), and fake marble counters in bathrooms (agreement promises marble counters, but the developer wants us to accept cheap plywood).
* no gas noc: the apartment promised piped gas, but apparently gail did not oblige due to a lack of adherence to norms. so, the condo provides gas via [gas cylinders stored on the premises](https://youtube.com/shorts/jqhdw-ysecc?feature=share), which need special noc but is not there. both ksfes and bbmp are aware of this but have taken no action.

# what we’ve done

* before we purchased, we had a lawyer look through the documents. based on the documents, things seemed acceptable, but the documents turned out to be misleading. law says oc means everything has been checked and the building is fit for occupation, but reality seemed different.
* escalated to developer: we sent numerous emails to the crm team, then to the ceo, and finally to the chairman. there was no substantial response, so we had to continue the legal route.
* more than 20 of fellow resident owners sent a letter to management, but the issues have not been completely resolved. here is the [letter issued over six months ago](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_ro2eixahtnd5uvkructflm9hx6orw4w/view), but there has been no action so far.
* legal action: filed a rera case (unsuccessful outcome) with all the information we had. the unfavourable order was in spite of [rera's engineers report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uks4nwxovafodd4c_grwrkw2zxwgafgi/view?usp=drive_link) that apartments are not complete, and also recording that developer obstructed inspection of amenities. an appeal is pending with the high court, which also granted an injunction on the apartment sale (for which we are grateful!).
* developer’s response: ignoring us, threatening prolonged legal battles, and trying to force us to accept subpar conditions and withdraw our cases (or face the delay in courts). (note: they recently issued a cancellation letter on false grounds to harass us. we challenged in the high court)

# blatant apathy of authorities

* bbmp – oc issued despite ongoing penthouse construction, no bescom connection, incomplete façade, flouting of fire (ksfes) norms, incomplete clubhouse, and pool having no oc.
* fire department – how was noc issued when norms for gas piping and storage were not followed?
* lift (department of electrical inspectorate) – how can lift freefall on multiple occasions if the inspection was done thoroughly?
* rera – how was completion status granted without a completion certificate, bescom sanction letter, inadequate noc, or noc for lifts? even despite a written complaint, how was it ignored?
* leela hotels – how did leela hotels lend their brand without due diligence?

# current situation

* our 75% deposit is still with the developer, along with both apartments. to further harass us, the developer has even issued a cancellation letter with a 1 crore penalty.
* we are struggling with ongoing legal battles and relentless mental harassment.
* it has become clear that the developer is well-versed in navigating legal cases and working with the authorities. despite this, we trust that the truth will ultimately prevail.
* as a last resort, given that the developer has spared no effort in trying to intimidate us, we are taking to social media to expose their tactics, make them accountable, and seek advice on how to resolve this situation.

# how can you help?

we trust the legal and judicial system and following due process. however, we have been made aware that things take its own time (to the developer's advantage). please share if you've faced similar issues or have any advice on tackling such fraud.

* any social media contacts to amplify the message
* any media contacts (digital or print)
* any specific legal approach that may have worked
* any government contacts

# how can you avoid this mess?

tl;dr ""devil is in the details""

before investing in nikoo homes or any other project, always request for:

* spend on a decent lawyer to get title check done.
* detailed specifications for materials (instead of vague terms like 'imported' or 'similar brand'), verify specifics for critical infrastructure such as road width and park size (park can be 7 acres or 70 sft!)
* insist on key documents such as the fire clearance, completion certificate, deed of declaration, kspcb clearance, bescom noc, bescom load sanction letter (this is different from noc) as necessary.
* speak to owners from same project and other projects completed by that developer.
* ensure that all promises the developer makes are clearly documented and legally binding.
* verify access points and other essential amenities to avoid future disputes."

reddit,2024-08-12 18:17:55,"do you think civil disobedience just like we had in the british raj will help in saving this nation?  there are multiple ways to manifest your emotions. i don't support any kind of violence against anyone in politics or government or any other authorities because it only makes matters worse. at the end of the day, political stability is the main key to economic progress. if there is no political stability in your nation, you're failure is inevitable. 

one of the key moments in india's struggle against the british was the civil disobedience moment. i've read a similar kind of a moment happened in iceland few decades ago when women came out and decided not to participate in household work or any other kind of work unless they weren't given equally treated and this worked well for icelandic women. 

considering the sad state of our country - pollution, garbage, joblessness, people dying of infrastructure fails, religious bigotry, rapes, all kinds of crime against women  etc. etc. - do you think to manifest your anger and frustration against the authorites, we should all go for civil disobedience. 

honestly, a moment like this in my opinion wouldn't have any effect in india, because the nation is more divided on caste, religion etc. than it has ever been. on top of that, because of our humungous population and a fucked up job market - people will always be willing to work since everyone needs to feed themselves and their families. 

what do you think? pragmatically is there a way we could tackle this - if not on a national level, atleast local or state levels.."

government hospitals:

take the kolkata incident for example, there was no rest room, the poor doctor was on a 36 hour shift and had to resort to seminar room for rest. not to forget that there were no cctv cameras.

there is a on contract person who is so high on his connections and abuse of power that he is allowed to do whatever he wants and had no remorse whatsoever on being caught.

the principal resigns and is handled a new responsibility within 24 hours.

the state gov, central gov. will not pay any heed to improve the infrastructure or even hear the complaints of the poor doctors.

the protests will go on and on until the doctors get tired and poor chaps return to their jobs with a sad heart.

  
sports:

sunil chettri said this, so have many others, there is no process or a system to identify or nurture the right talent in india.

most of the sportspersons are from very humble backgrounds (read poor) no well earning parent wants their child to enroll for any sports or pursue a career because they know that there is a high chance that their child is destined for failure or not being able to achieve greatness.

china has 170k stadiums compared to india which does not even have 1/10th

china's sports budget for 2023 was 26560 cr vs india which is at 3452 cr

indian sports is full of politics

all politicians, private investores come to laud the athletes once they have achieved something. up until then, it is the athlete's own journey. 

vinesh phogat was struggling for her visa before the olympics.

the athletes protested with full force last year but still his son is the head of the body.

do you really think there is any seriousness, no there is not



business

time and again, so many international level entrepreneurs and business house have said that it is so so so difficult to do business in india. musk said this once and so many others.

  
per capita income

it is all numbers and stats but on ground level, the poor is getting poorer by each passing day.

  
3rd biggest economy

we talk about becoming the 3rd biggest economy, bullshit!  
we can become one because of the n number of states that we have and their contribution, not because we are doing something extraordinary.  
  
we compete with japan, england etc who are 1/100th the size of our country.

sad part is that we feel no shame whatsoever in boasting facts like these.



civil infrastructure

i live in a gurgaon locality where the rents are about 50k for a good 2bhk but come rains, the reality pops up with waterlogging everywhere. we are in a metro city for god sake. the local mla is a corrupt, money hoarder politician who keeps on hopping parties and i am 100% sure he has 0 clue about what are the problems faced by people of the city, the cm was the same, he had to be changed. 

not only gurugram, every other city is the same. what i want to cry my eyes out about is the fact no one fucking no one has this common sense that monsoons create a havoc every year so lets for once lets get the gutters cleaned before monsoons. noone does it in delhi, gurgaon or any other city nearby.

but yes, everyone wants to be a part of the photo op. kejriwal sucks, so does bjp and i will not mention congress cos they are no different.

have to cut the rant cos hona isse bhi kuch nahi hai, karna maine be kuch nahi

reddit,2024-08-13 18:31:48,"this is the ""developing"" india i don't even know if this is called ""developing"". 
i have spent my 18 years living in this country and in this particular state and city. 
it's heart breaking because it's not the city as people think it is. 
my particular city where i live it should not even be called city because it's none like one. 
roads are not at all developed, littrely a road was built after 5 years and not even month went by its has several holes in it and when i say it's several i mean it. light gets cutoff 5 times a day and sometimes 8 hours went by and there is no electricity, if call to complain or even ask why electricity is gone no one picks up the call. 
traffic is hell, venders occupy half of the street and other half is covered byfreep illegal parking, not a single vehicle is moved or even given warning from toe company. 
traffic rules are nothing over here and trains are packed like overflowing garbage can. 
there is no sopt of cleanliness. 
government is sleeping. 
i had little upi fraud occur to me 3 months ago, it was not a large amount only 600₹ but my friends and family told me to report it as amount doesn't matter, so i reported it knowing fully well it's not going to be solved but whatever. few days go by and my bank account is blocked,when called cyber crime no one littrely no one picked up the call, i called more than 10 times still no answer or even callbback, thank god for a good police officer who told me what to do and helped to unblock my bank account. he was shocked too of why my bank account was blocked? anyways my fraudsters has yanked around 50 thousands money from several people thank god i didn't go that deep and stopped at 600 only. i have his every details from phone number to upi id and even his bank name and transaction id. whatever but this is not at all ""developing"". 
edit : for those who think i am blaming one political parties than no. my city is not even run by ang major political party. it's not under bjp or even congress. it's entirely different partie which is ruling for 40 years. and yes there was introduction and winning of other parties. result we faced very bad electricity as well as water cut off. i am not on side of any parties neither bjp nor congress because for me both are same. no matter which parties rules our situation is not going to change unless we voice our opinion."
reddit,2024-08-13 22:55:35,"abysmal power cuts in mahadevapura for hours everyday. i stay exactly opposite to the bagmane tech park near the more market in mahadevapura. every 2-3 hours there's a power cut for 20-30 minutes. it drizzles, 1 hour power  cut. it rains, 3-4 hours easily. it rains heavily 7+ hours.

the absolute state of this city's infra is just pathetic. i come from a tier 2 city in tn. there used to be a time when we had scheduled power cuts for 2 hours everyday during the late 2000s. even then, power would be gone only for that 2 hours. 

no right to call itself"
reddit,2024-08-14 00:12:06,"power cuts i moved to bangalore recently and i have lived in most major cities in india- delhi, noida, kolkata, mumbai but i have never seen this amount of power cuts anywhere. i rented a flat without power backup because i didn't know that's a major issue here. can anyone tell me how do i deal with this?
are there invertes/batteries available for rent? if yes can anyone tell me where can i?"

reddit,2024-08-14 03:14:02,"father's workplace, a restaurant, not giving salary for two months; he did something and people came home with threats. my father started working in a restaurant (near madiwala, bangalore). started with promises of around 15000 a month. the job involved anything from day to day managing, purchases and even basic cooking. the restaurant is on the brink of closing, they haven't paid anyone their actual salary but only bits now and then. currently, they at the lowest owe us 10000+. this is not even including the work my father did for them when they were starting the restaurant. it's more like 20000+ i think.

the place is drowning in debt and the building owner have been telling them to leave, and as far as i know, he is in the process of cutting electricity.

the few thousands and few hundred we got were only after a ridiculous amount of back and forth talks. he was consistently going to work at first but since they were failing to pay and since he has to find some other work, my father only went back after they made promises to pay, but this going back and forth and promises happened many times but he was only paid peanuts.

we are in a difficult situation with two months rent pending, our landlord was starting to get annoyed and we are barely holding on with my inconsistent payment i get from my freelance online gigs.

the whole situation has been heating up and my father have begged, reasoned etc to get the payment and is trying to get an other job. since our landlord was getting annoyed, and because of the aholes runnig the restaurant, my father did something, it was stupid i guess, idk.

he started going again last week as the salary payment is supposed to fall around this time of the month but they are not paying. so two days ago, my father came back with the scooter from the restaurant, it was not a bad situation at first but he did not go to work today and was holding on to the scooter, told them many times to pay up, but nothing intense, was not even angry. it was not explicitly said but it was obvious my father was holding the scooter hostage.

yesterday evening, two people came home and threatened my father, one guy responsible for the restaurant and other guy supposedly came to solve the current situation but was obviously not. the guy was about to hit my father and there was a heated situation here. they tried to force entry into our home but mom stood ground an talked back. then the landlord came. anyway, the situation went on like that for an hour and the guy was trying to pounce on my father constantly.

my father refused to give the scooter's key unless they pay up today. they said they were going to call the police, or that they are going to ""deal"" with my father, and that they are never going to pay. they claimed my father does not show up for work. but my mother said that that is not true and even if that is true, they would still owe us for when he did go, this shut up the ""mediator"" guy. the restaurant guy is a proper thug and implied and said a lot of threats and he is dead set on doing something and never paying.

also, they said the restaurant lost all of today's business and lost money because of not having the scooter for buying daily raw materials, and that we should pay them (?!!?). the restaurant barely opened today because their building owner cut power to parts of the restaurant and most of the employees have left. they do not even have the money to buy cooking oil, vegetables etc.

we're all from outside the state, restaurant people too, but they've been here forever and has more connections, i'm pretty sure involving cops straight up will go bad for us. they kept saying things like they will not let us live here, that they know this city and what not.

a ""decision"" was made and my father gave them the key, he is supposed to go to the restaurant today so they can give him all the money after checking attendance. the landlord helped a tiny bit by being present, her tried not to intervene much but it was still helpful. but at the end, before leaving, the guy said he is going deal with my father, my father didn't help and said that we have people here too to deal with things, which the mediator guy replied with more threats. the ""mediator"" also invited my mother to go with my father so she can check the attendance, he said. i don't think they are going to pay and i'm pretty sure they are going to do something to my father. but my father is sure there are people who are going to support him but i'm not so sure about that.

i did not intervene at all. i sleep during day time after working the night, i was woken up by the commotion all panicy, i already have sleep issues and just recovered from a fever, i was all light headed, felt like i needed to just sit, i think my bp was high or something. i tried taking video but did not get the thug's face, also not sure how a video is going to help as my father, angry but mostly reasonable, has also said some unwanted things.

we are in a difficult situation all around. it's obvious but i also gotta say, we got insulted as fck as this a residential area with families and all.

tldr; dad was not being paid by restaurant where he works/worked. they made promise after promise, but no fish. the restaurant is on the brink of closing, havent paid any bills and many of the employees. we are barely surviving on my inconsistent income. we havent paid two months rent and the land lord was getting annoyed, which finally flipped my father, he took the restaurant's scooter hostage. two people came home and made a ton of threats and a fight nearly broke out, one guy constantly was trying to hit my father. they tried to force entry to home, stopped by mom and then landlord intervened. they called my father a thug for taking the scooter, it was not by force, basically, he was given the scooter but my father refused give it back, indirectly. they said they were going to call the cops or ""deal"" with my father. they are much more powerful compared to us. the heated situation was ""solved"" without anything physical, invited my dad and even my mom to the restaurant to settle the payment. but they made serious threats again, which my dad responded by saying that we have people here to and that we can also deal with it, which was met with more threats in a more serious manner. i'm sure they are not going to ever pay and also that they are going to do something, i'm also sure police will side with them as they are more influential/powerful, which they clarified over and over again.

really sorry for the long post, idk where else to ask, don't have the resource to just go legal.

update: they've agreed to pay in full this weekend, after we called up some people. they let the restaurant people know it won't go well for them if this escalates. seems like they don't want trouble as they are truggling with finances, the restaurant is closed temporarily. they were calm when the ""mediator"" called."

reddit,2024-08-15 13:47:23,"indians need to take a good-hard look at their country  i hate to be a negative nancy but i think this needs to be said. indians don’t realize the truth, the ground reality of their country. we have adopted the worst aspects of democracy. our politicians use jingoism, religious and cultural pride, hatred for minorities, and a strongman image to distract us from our problem to vote for them. the media inculcates pride, hatred for minorities, and sensationalism to get views and help politicians win elections. the pelicans have literally taken a leaf out of real fascism. they don’t talk about the real issues facing the ordinary man, hence most indians are completely delusional.

do people realize their water, air, food, and ground is poisonous and polluted? our infrastructure is a complete failure. nothing works and people don’t seem to care. do people realize that we won zero gold medals in olympics despite being the most populated nation and having 50% of our population below 25 years of age? the state of policing and the judiciary. the appalling wealth gap.

hating on minorities has become a full-time career now. no matter how many times diljit says he loves india there will be people who call him a separatist without remorse.

when foreigners or indians complain about the appalling situation in india, there are people who hate on them. it is like a business complaining about bad reviews by the customers. if you don’t want people to complain then fix the issues. 

“oh but what about our culture and traditions?! we may be poor but we so relgious and sanskari!”

culture has deteriorated and spiralling downwards. the youth’s iq, attention span, and ability to follow logic seems to have gone down. there will be comments on social media and videos that say complete nonsense, whataboutism and something completely out of context to win an argument. conspiracy theories and pseudoscience has increased among young people.

don’t believe me, just watch the latest movies like animal and adipurush. listen to the latest songs the youth listens to. in facts what’s indian about the youth anyway? unpopular opinion but the fact is most rich kids prefer talking in english most of the time. the younger generations seem more brainwashed, superstitious, negligent, radicalized, and nihilistic than their parents. they have adopted the worst aspects of both cultures. what i see is a bunch of wanna be americans who are also somehow ultra prideful and backwards (animal + adipurush). **so, we are neither prosperous nor are we as naive and innocent as our previous generations before.** 

most people and youth just want to make a quick buck and don’t care how the country is doing or how their actions affect india in the long term. it’s the “jugad” mentality; there’s no perfectionism in the work; everything is half@$$ed. we work hard only until we get a comfortable govt. job then it’s smooth sailing from then on.

what was needed was an embrace of new idea, technology, science and modernity to change with the times. instead we have people clinging to old, millennia old, traditions and trying to justify them through pseudoscience. people wanting to “go back” as far as possible. it’s dangerous and a waste of time.

no matter how much the media would like you to believe, our perception around the world has not improved. i live in north america since 2012 and, long story short, before they did not know about us and now there are all kinds of negative stereotypes about us. this “our reputation has improved” because of ambani’s wedding or whatever other reason is simply propaganda.  

look at other counties who have gone from poor to rich. look at china and singapore, can’t we learn from them? 

i know there will be people who don’t agree with me and will writing long replies. the thing is, this isn’t so much an opinion but something you can see yourself if you are not delusional. we have picked up being argumentative for no reason from the news channel debates we see on tv."

reddit,2024-08-20 19:03:42,"please be cautious of any foodstuff you buy from local vendors i experience a little indigestion and that's specifically why i had decided to include a glass of lassi in my diet to keep my stomach intact. i had a specific dairy from where i bought malai lassi every single time. however, my family and a few friends recommended me a new vendor who makes fresh lassi every day for his customers. i was buying lassi from him for about a month so far.

yesterday, while scrolling through reddit, my eyes suddenly went through the recent mountain dew feud. i was surprised by their statement that the rat's flesh, if present, would have melted into a jelly-ish structure in the soda can. at that time, i didn't know why that thought was in my mind while going to buy a lassi for myself.

usually i just buy and slurp lassi without giving another thought. but i don't know what made me do it, but i just closed my eyes and said, ""jesus."" i was eating a bit of malai on the top of my glass, and took a spoon of lassi. to my utter shock, there was a spider in my lassi. i immediately stopped, and showed it to the vendor. i spit all of it out, and the vendor bought me some water to gargle. i think i might've eaten a bit of the malai on the top. i hope that's not harmful, given my indigestion problem.

in retrospect, i feel like i should've taken a picture, but i was too focused on getting the lassi out of my mouth. had i not read that feud yesterday, or had i bought a full glass malai lassi, i might have actually slurped the spider in, i guess...

so please always check your food out before you eat, especially when you buy a take-out. also, maybe a little spirituality might help, i guess?

take care, everybody :)"

someday knows about it!?"
reddit,2024-08-22 20:12:35,"frequent power cuts in bangalore are disrupting our lives—what’s going on bescom? i’m beyond frustrated with the constant power cuts in bangalore. in a city that’s home to the highest number of it firms, it’s absurd that we’re dealing with 2-3 hour power outages every other day. with the hybrid working model becoming the norm, it’s nearly impossible to work from home under these conditions.

bescom’s reliability is seriously questionable. how can something be “under maintenance” every single day? are they really fixing anything, or are we just caught in an endless cycle of band-aid solutions? the lack of transparency and frequent outages are not just inconvenient—they’re damaging to our productivity and well-being.

has anyone else been experiencing this? what can we do to hold bescom accountable and push for a more reliable power supply? this can’t continue if bangalore wants to maintain its status as a leading tech hub."

has this happened to someone before? what’s the motive? was they trying to cut the fuel pipe? or start the vehicle?"

reddit,2024-08-24 14:24:44,"five years for a metro phase 3. wtf  
metro phase three has been approved and is expected to take five years to complete. why does the government require so much time for these types of projects?
i don't understand. five years for just one metro project? how will we ever be able to complete other projects at this rate?
we won't be able to beat the traffic with this growth rate. in those five years, another batch of new people will move to the city, and the traffic problem will remain the same as it is today.
if we want to address the traffic issue, the government needs to work on public transportation infrastructure at a faster pace.
in countries like china, small projects like this are completed within a month. however, in india, everyone seems to want a percentage of the money. this slow development also leads to blocked roads and further traffic problems."

reddit,2024-08-27 14:18:53,"the root cause of all problems in bangalore, as i see, is rapid urbanization.  the other day i had to travel from whitefield to electronic city for work. the way i travelled was varthur-mullur-kodathi-huskur-e city. i went on this route after some 5 years. 
it was really depressing, and i could not stop but think about how the bangalore city is ""progressing"" 

the root cause of all problems in bangalore, as i see, is rapid urbanization. 

during british and royal times, a lot of the city was developed by them. these are the nice city areas we think about bangalore - the central city, jayanager, malleswaram etc. places around the city were and still really is in a way, villages. for a long time, bangalore is just some industries, govt institutions, retired people etc. 

then it boom happened and the population exploded in bangalore. now bangalore has become a cash cow. lot of people want to create office campuses in bangalore. a lot of the people who will come to work there, need apartments, schools, hospitals and all the other stuff. 

the village areas around bangalore get reclaimed and suddenly there is glitzy, huge office campuses sprouting there. then apartments sprout up in the same neighbourhood. nobody stops to think about developing the supporting infrastructure. the roads, the bridges, water, the bus-train network. there is no time. focus is on building these real estate and selling at a premium. you would think the bad infrastructure, the lack of water would temper some of this. no. there is a never-ending line of people who are either greedy or unaware who are buying into the dream. 

people are thinking, i am getting a great deal on this apt. since the area is just developing. once it is developed it would be a great place. just get into your mind - that area is not becoming that developed area, never. in a normal place market forces would self-correct. but since we have a never-ending line of people who are buying into the stupid dream they look at the property prices that only go one way and think happy thoughts. 
there is a lot of buyers from out-of-area. so this also keeps the stupid dream alive. 

just look around varthur area. one after other, apartments from tier-1 builders. the road quality near them, still 20 years prior. everything around it a half-village state. neither village nor a city. everything is covered in a permanent cover of dust, because the construction never ends,and the roads are all broken. there are 4 international schools on that road, one after the other, showing that pseudo-developed-country look. there is a road-widening planned there, which is going to probably take the next 10 years. 

once you get out of these ""newly-developing"" areas, there are 2 types of bangalore. one is places which are still villages. bam! you are surrounded by flower fields, vegetable fields, hardworking farmers on the field. there is a lake on the other side of that field that still has water.you have to look twice to remind yourself you are still in the 'uru. the other is those places trying to get into the ""newly-developing"" list. these are marked by the worst roads that havent seen an ounce of tar in decades. some roads around huskur fruit market, and that railway under-cross that gets flooded - you would think some improvement in so many years? but nothing. 

all that population who comes here with dreams, very soon have to face the reality of all these. the traffic, the pollution, the high costs of everything. all the people coming to be part of the supporting ecosystem, the drivers, the delivery guys, the cooks and waiters from far-off states and districts, they all live this reality. it is no wonder the heated emotions on the road flare up."

reddit,2024-09-01 06:32:13,"from september 1, power will be disconnected if bills are not paid: bescom the bangalore electricity supply company on friday [said](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/karnataka/bengaluru/from-september-1-power-will-be-disconnected-if-bills-are-not-paid-state-owned-firm-bescom-3171050) that from september 1, if consumers fail to pay electricity charges within 30 days of receiving bills or do not pay the required additional security deposit, it would disconnect their power supply.

a period of 15 days is provided for electricity bill payments until the due date without interest, the power company said, adding that an additional 15-day grace period is available for payments with interest after the due date. ""however, if the bill remains unpaid, the electricity supply will be disconnected on the next meter reading day."" bescom said.

currently, defaulters get much more than 30 days to pay outstanding bills. from sep 1, if bills are not paid within 30 days, power supply will be disconnected."

reddit,2024-09-02 18:11:18,"advice for daily 7km office travel in bangalore i'm looking for some advice on commuting options for a daily 7km travel to my office (near hosa road to hsr layout). the bus routes nearby are 1-2km apart from where i stay and to the office too. currently, i’ve tried several options but haven't found a satisfactory solution:

* **rapido, ola, uber**: these are quite costly, especially during peak hours or in traffic. the fares are around rs. 250 for a day and sometimes i face issues with availability.
* **yulu**: i’ve tried yulu bikes, but there are no yulu zones near my place. so, i need to walk around 1.5km to get to the nearest yulu zone. and also sometimes yulu bikes are not reliable as it seems or i don't know to select the proper bike each time.

given these challenges, i'm exploring other options and would appreciate any recommendations or insights. specifically:

1. **other commute options**: are there any alternative methods for daily commuting that i might have overlooked?
2. **second-hand bikes**: would buying a second-hand bike be a viable solution? if so, should i go for an electric bike or a fuel-based one?

thanks in advance!"

reddit,2024-09-04 20:15:29,"anyone else feel like they're starting from scratch at 30? looking for friends, support, &amp; deep conversations. okay, reddit, here goes nothing. just throwing this out into the void, hoping it finds someone, anyone, who gets it. 30. just turned 30. feel like i’ve aged a decade in the last year. this whole ‘being an adult’ thing really sucks sometimes. went through a brutal breakup. brutal, i tell you. supported her, emotionally, financially, for over a year while she was unemployed. thought we were in it together, you know? then, bam, she lands a job and i'm out. replaced. disposable. like i was just some stepping stone. started seeing other guys almost immediately. killed me. absolutely gutted my self-worth. like, what am i even worth if someone can treat me like that after everything i did? maybe it’s because i’m not some trust fund kid, haven't got that generational wealth safety net. maybe that makes me less desirable, less worthy in some twisted way. it just makes you question everything.



been a hermit for the last 4-5 months. needed to rebuild, piece by piece. had to cut off a huge chunk of my social circle, they were all mutual friends. feels like i'm starting from scratch. it’s lonely as hell. i've got a few close friends, but i need more. people who get it, who want to push themselves, who aren’t afraid to dive deep. i want those deep, intrinsic connections. i want to be surrounded by people who ignite that fire in me, you know? help me reach my potential. people who are on a similar journey, trying to build themselves up, become better versions of themselves. i'm really looking for that kind of growth-oriented mindset



**so here's what i'm looking for, reddit. are there any others out there like me?**



before the whole… everything… i was working towards some big goals. had to put them on hold, didn't have the mental capacity. but now, i'm ready to dust them off. i want to set up my own fund - been in finance for a while and have a specific strategy i want to test out. get back into boxing, used to love it. the discipline, the physicality, it was a great outlet. and definitely, absolutely, continue to not speak to my ex. she just wants the emotional support, zero accountability. done with that.



there’s more to me than just those goals though. i write poetry. tons of it. like, 3 or 4 thousand pages this year alone. don't know what to do with it all. maybe i’ll share it someday. perhaps find some other poets to connect with, workshop some pieces, get some feedback. **anyone interested in poetry? maybe even starting a poetry group?** philosophy keeps me up at night, the big questions, you know? the meaning of life, consciousness, the nature of reality. love science and technology, always trying to learn about the latest advancements, the future of ai, space exploration - that kind of stuff. **always looking for people to discuss these kinds of topics with!** jazz and rap are my jams, i play electric guitar – anyone else out there? used to devour books, like 100+ a year, two years ago. want to get back into that. love discussing new ideas, but… no one to talk to. maybe even start a little book club? **anyone up for a book club?**



and man, **i really need an accountability partner.** someone to keep me on track, call me out when i’m slacking. someone who gets that drive. we can check in with each other, set goals, support each other's progress. someone who's serious about self-improvement. **is anyone looking for an accountability partner too?**



dating apps are a no-go. not mentally ready for that shit show. just want genuine connections, friendships, not looking for hookups. besides, i’m pretty average looking, maybe even below average. maybe that’s just my shattered self-esteem talking, haha. **seriously though, just looking for platonic friendships.**



so yeah, that’s me. raw and unfiltered. if any of this resonates, hit me up. let’s build each other up, chase our dreams, and maybe even change the world a little bit along the way. just… someone please tell me i’m not alone in this. looking for those deep conversations, the kind that make you think and challenge your perspective. people who are passionate about something, anything really. let's connect, share ideas, and create something amazing. **hit me up if you want to chat, grab coffee (or a beer), or just connect online. i'm really looking forward to hearing from you.**"

reddit,2024-09-05 22:28:12,"why it is east bangalore always?  not just today's incident, most of the crime, harassment reports these days from bangalore comes from eastern part of the city. very curious to understand why that is the case. 

not just crimes and harassments, even infrastructure issues,
1. water scarcity happened - it hit only east bangalore. 
2. potholes are more in east bangalore
3. electricity issues are more in east bangalore. 
4. auto driver issues - more in east bangalore. 

by east bangalore i mean - whitefield, indiranagar, koramangala, sarjapura, varthur, marathalli etc. 

why these issues are not prominent in other parts of bangalore? i don't see any of these issues happening much there. 

any reasons why? what are others doing right that we are not? or are these areas just silent about the things happening to them?"

reddit,2024-09-07 00:25:03,"amazon delivery guy made me pay for a prepaid order. what should i do? tldr; i was forced to pay for a prepaid charge, and it's been about a month, amazon is not refunding my amount. i did complain at the consumer forum, but i didn't hear back from them. eventually amazon paid me twice. so the product is free :p 
  
on 8th of august, i ordered a yamaka keyboard, which was supposed to arrive on 12th of aug, a gift for someone.  
  
i made the payment online for the same on 8th itself.

https://preview.redd.it/zh53ypyzf8nd1.jpg?width=1084&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45a6a6e00ced34ed4484157cec596352594e1f16

on 12th the delivery guy comes to my home at about 11 am, calls me outside, starts searching his vehicle for the product, but he fails to find it, and i'm like, no problem bhaiyya, jab mile tab aa jaana... main ghar k andar wait karta hun   
  
he went, without informing me.

i called him, 2 hours later, he said he couldn't find my product, but once he does, he'll come back. but he didn't come till 5 pm. i called him, but he didn't receive it, and started ignoring my calls.  
  
i called him multiple times, finally, he picked up and requested me to go to the warehouse.

i went to the warehouse at about 6:30 pm.   
i told them the situation. they started searching for my product in the warehouse. only to find nothing(or they pretended to not find it).  
  
they kept asking my to go back, but i couldn't, it was a gift, and timing matters, right?

so, at about 7:45 pm, i spot the product right there. i asked them to take it out, and they did.   
  
i thought finally i'll be able to take it home. but wait a minute, here's when the actual problem started!!

they read the label on it, and informed me that the product got returned. i was shocked since i didn't return it. i asked them to take care of it anyway, roll back or something, and hand over my product to me.  
  
then, the emotional blackmail started.

""sir, the product has been returned for some reason, and the refund to you is also initiated, if we still hand over the product to you, we'll suffer loss. we(the delivery agents) hardly get 15 rupees per order. how will we pay this huge amount""

so, i called the amazon customer care. first thing first, please note , you just can't get to amazon customer care with your complaints. these people have made it tougher than climbing the everest.   
  
but i knew how to reach out, because of previous experiences.

the customer executive told me the product wasn't returned as per their system and the delivery agents are sharing the wrong information with you. you tell them to give it to you(as if i didn't request them a million times already)

finally, at about 8:45 pm, after literally talking to the customer executive for an hour, one of the warehouse managers said, you give us cash and take the product, anyways the refund is already initiated.  i was like, ""brother, you could've told this earlier""  
  
finally, relieved!

i was about to transfer 13179 to one of the delivery agents when somebody pointed out that i have to transfer 14399, the cost before the bank discount. i was like, that's not happening, i got the discount online already. why should i miss that!!

again the emotional blackmailing started, and i finally gave up, left the warehouse, and was on the road to my home.  
  
but i was restless, why!!  
why is the customer taken as granted by these big companies nowadays??  
and so i decided to return to the warehouse at about 9.  
i told them, see it's your mistake that you returned the product, you suffer the loss, why should i pay extra. you are so many people, just split the extra 1200 rupees loss among yourself. and they agreed.   
  
i was about to pay 13179. and then it hit me!!  
  
what if they mark my order as lost in transit??  
i won't be able to claim warranty or replace the product incase there's an issue discovered later, right??   
  
so i took a video of them confirming:

https://reddit.com/link/1famwuv/video/2hf7fw59h8nd1/player

  
  
the manager ordered ""rollback and mark as deliver, bro""

finally, i paid 13179 to one of the delivery person, but my pessimistic soul wasn't satisfied.  
  
what if i took the product, and went home, only to realize they didn't mark the order as delivered, so i waited till 10 pm, and made sure they marked it delivered

the next day, i checked for the refund message, but none was received. i called customer support, and registered a case. was asked to wait for 72 hours.  
  
i waited, no response.  
i called again, they told me they were creating a new case and i needed to wait for another 72 hours. and mind you, this is after i spend about 30 mins or so, repeating my entire story.  
  
after 72 hours, no response, i call again, repeat same story again, same reply again and repeat.

https://preview.redd.it/8jgus10vj8nd1.jpg?width=719&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeb06c0d2657c28d0b7064f1403b91127a6813f8

so, this has been going on for the last 20 days, no solution. and now they just drop my call after hearing all the story.  
  
 i'm done. i am literally done, this is mentally very draining to tell your story again and again, that too for 13k??

i am not gonna be satisfied with just the refund of this. i want to sue them through a consumer forum.

these guys think we don't have any rights at all and treat us like we're nobody.

kindly provide me a low-cost solution for pressing legal charges on amazon.


edit: the product that i was so hell bent on taking home was broken, i found this after i took it home. probably the reason why the product was returned in the first place. i placed a replacement order for that the very next day, and received it.

edit: ofc i can go to the police, but you guys lose.

edit:

*processing img y36ozxo9wmod1...*


guess what, i still ain't convinced it was a scam. amazon has accepted their mistake and promised to return my money. but crazy how retardians jump to blame you for your misery.

i was here to ask if i can sue amazon, but looks like there are way too many amazon ass lickers here.

indeed, an amazon system flaw. not customer's.

thank you everyone who supported. some of you'll dm'ed to show support 🥹🥹

oh btw, this happened without me going to the police. 

some of you advised me to mail to jeff@amazon.com and this either seems to be the result of that, or i had twitted on twitter 2 weeks back, so that could be a contributing factor too.

but it was expedited quickly. what irritates me too much is those fkrs had me call every 3rd day for last one month and talked to me for 30-45 mins. without giving me any update. that was a literal torture man. 

for those of you who were blaming me for this,
1) i'll say you lack empathy or passion.
2) i hope someday you go through worse experience, but hope you'll suffer alone and take it as a lesson and move on instead of fighting back, because that's what you have been doing all life right? settle too soon?

well, whatever gives you a good night's sleep."

reddit,2024-09-07 02:09:58,"is there any negative stereotype that indians still haven't hit yet? as an indian, it's so sad and depressing to see all the negative stereotypes against indians. unfortunately, majority of them are true. it's a pretty shame we have more negative stereotypes than any other country. some of the worst i've come across are scam callers, terrible smelly people, unhygienic food makers and eaters, creepy weird pervert online, rapists men, unclean filthy streets and garbage everywhere, street poopers, cow piss drinkers, etc. and the list will still go.

i really don't think any other country or race have this much of negative stereotypes. i think, we gotta admit and acknowledge most of them are true and try to educate our fellow citizens. india really has to improve a lot when it comes to civic sense. we must break these stereotypes and try to avoid such non-sense in future. man, looking at the number of these stereotypes, i'm even scared to go out of this country bcos of how foreigners will treat me knowing that i'm an indian. recently, there has been a massive large number of hateful posts against india and indian people because of these stereotypes.

reddit,2024-09-09 08:40:28,"with the below news report can we have a hope of having better potfree roads in bangalore? as the state government talks about improving mobility, undertaking construction of highways and expressways, and an 18-km long tunnel road in bengaluru, experts point out that the basic requirement of commuters is left unanswered: good roads.
last wednesday, when it-bt minister priyank kharge said karnataka was way ahead of any other state in information technology in india, netizens and citizens pointed out that the city lagged in providing basic infrastructure, like filling up potholes.

deputy chief minister and bengaluru in-charge minister was trolled and criticised for his statement ""bengaluru roads are far better than delhi's"", bengalureans said: ""do not compare, instead ensure roads are improved in bengaluru, which is an it hub.""

shivakumar also set a 15 day-deadline for bruhat bengaluru mahanagara palike (bbmp) engineers to fill up potholes. on september 2, he promised that 2,795 potholes in the city will be repaired within 15 days. he also announced an allocation of rs 600 crore to repair all major roads in the city.

but bbmp engineers have pointed a finger at protesting contractors and said the deadline cannot be met. ""how can we work when there are no contractors? we have 5,000 bags of cold mix in our plant to repair roads, each bag weighing 35kg. the weather is also apt, but there is little assistance to do the work,"" a bbmp official said.

a senior bbmp official said it costs rs 600-1000 to fill a pothole. ""there is no dearth of funds to fill the potholes, and work is happening. the maximum complaints are from the city outskirts where developmental works are under progress,"" said a bbmp engineer. but citizens are not convinced. 

they assert that nothing is happening and point to the increasing number of road accidents and injuries commuters are suffering because of bad roads. they recollect an incident from october 2022, where a woman died after she was hit by a speeding bus, while trying to avoid a pothole opposite lulu mall in binnypet.

this is not a stray incident; there have been many instances after that, yet little has been done,"" said sakshi k, a banker, who suffered grievous injuries while trying to avoid a pothole at the same location in august 2024. ""nothing has changed. the potholed roads are there, accident locations keep changing. bbmp says they are filling potholes, they just resurface,"" she said.

it is not just citizens who have expressed anguish, the high court also pulled up government agencies over poor road conditions. in 2022, the karnataka high court directed bbmp to repair major roads within 10 days. the court recently took note of bad roads near its complex. orthopaedists point out that the number of people approaching them with spinal and knee pain are on the rise, and most of them are two-wheeler riders.

bbmp officials point fingers at government agencies like the public works department, bangalore water supply and sewerage board, energy department and private companies laying optic fibre cables, for the poor road condition.

""under the nirbhaya scheme, the police department is cutting roads to lay cables for installing cameras. bengaluru is a developing and growing city, so for utilities, other agencies dig roads. a pothole is a circular shaped structure and is an inferior part of the road. but that is not the only damage on a road. in bengaluru, roads are not meant only for traffic, but are also a space for other underground utilities,"" said the bbmp engineer.


but experts are not convinced. slamming the condition of roads, they said the degrees of engineers should be seized and they should be sent back to learn the basics of road engineering.

prof ashish verma, convener, iisc sustainable transportation lab, department of civil engineering, iisc said: ""even if the potholes are filled properly, they will re-appear. this is either done purposely or due to lack of basic engineering knowledge. potholes are not just in bengaluru, but in delhi, mumbai and all other cities. but they are not seen in other countries, where there are black topped roads. 

the roads have a good life there because simple engineering rules and methods are strictly followed. the road is slightly raised in the centre and there are cross slope edges along with well maintained shoulder drains on both sides. this ensures there is no water stagnation and the runoff is smooth. these are also spelt out in the indian road congress guidelines, which should be strictly followed. engineers and contractors should be penalised for the poor road condition.""

officials in the urban development department and rural development and panchayat raj department said the problem of bad roads is not limited to bengaluru, but is seen in other two-and three-tier cities. an rdpr official mocked: ""roads in other cities have started to appear like those of malgudi days tales, where kuchha roads were seen."""

reddit,2024-09-10 12:53:46,"i think its time we respect every one in bangalore rather than being toxic to them.  i am writing based on my experience in bangalore for 27 years, i am 45 have seen bangalore transition in short period of time the reason why we are facing most problem these days. i have stayed in different locations like hsr, rajajinagar, whitefield, sarjapur. its very disheartening to see that city like this is getting famous for wrong reasons.                                                                                                                                                  

the most of the things which is going on between kannadigas and non kanndigas road rages was hugely contributed by autowalas in bangalore. not defending any one here but when you ask some one to speak your language there is way, if you really disrespect and humiliate  some one  you are making them feel bad about your culture. there is nothing wrong in asking some one to speak your language but there are ways to do it.

there times when i see some non kanndigas exploiting this situation and make it look one sided story who act as victims and show it has north vs south kind of things. i witnessed live incident where the car guy almost killed a scooty guy and later  when he reacted, it was shown as kannadiga being attacked on northie guy. we are reacting to these videos without even noticing what's happening behind the scenes. 

i feel its time we analyze things with common sense for both kannadigas and non kannadigas or else the situation would be worsened."

reddit,2024-09-12 19:55:47,"fasttag got damaged - takes 7-8 days for replacement my car glass got damaged and along with that the fasttag too got damaged. here are the options given by kotak:

1. apply for new fast-tag that takes 7-8 days.

2. cancel the fast-tag and apply through new bank. cancellation takes 7-8 days.

3. get it replaced through agent - who's locations are not fixed and are ""generally available"" near toll plaza. i went near the toll plaza, there were none from kotak. 

i know that the toll plaza can get it deducted from number plate, but not all toll plaza have this and have to pay double. also the moment you stop to tell them to initiate the deduction from number plate, the people on the back are not even ready to wait few seconds and will honk like there life is on the line. i have to leave urgently due to some work. we will see if we can find some agents roaming around.

  
as much as i appreciate the technology, the service and backup on the other hand is absolute garbage in edge cases."
reddit,2024-09-12 20:59:52,"my blr landlord is a fraud.  update 1

like most of the people in banglore i rent with my flatmate. yesterday, i got a call from my flatmate (since i am at my hometown) saying that there has been an issue in the building.
1. the electricity is cut since we haven't paid the bill. (ps: it was the owners responsibility to pay the july bill since we shifted on august 1st.)
2. the person that we finalized the deal with (let's call him mr. z) he is not the actual owner and the actual building owner (let's call him mr. r) has arrived. 

flash back to the day we were discussing our rental agreement 

so roommate and i were searching  apartments through a broker. the broker seemed genuine and pretty helpful. during the finalizations of agreement, we agreed that he would provide us a fully furnished apartment by 27th of july so that we can shift our belongings, so by the 1st of august the flat is livable. this discussions happened around 23 or 24th of july. he was suppose to do cabinet works in kitchen (since it was a co-live before). 

on july 29th we called him to ask about the progress and he said it will be ready by 31st and he is out of town and hence the work has slowed down. we agreed and gave him more time since we wanted to peacefully move in without much hassle. by this time we had already paid his deposit amount (1l) and signed the agreement for 11 months. 

during the packing process on the 31st, i called the owner asking him if all the work was done. he responded that bed frames will be ready in 2 hrs but cabinets are not done. (we were really starting to get frustrated at this point.) 

since we had already checked out of the previous house, we moved to this place. when we reached to our shock he had just started deep cleaning the house and we had to wait for 1 hr and get it done with helper he provided. 

the house did not have any furnishings as promised other than bed frames. we literally had to constantly nag him for everything. 

update 2

i called her back to ask for an update on the situation, and here is what she told me. 
1. mr. z is not the real owner. he had leased the property from mr. r. 
2. his lease was ending by august. 
3. he has taken money in advance for the apartments from various tenants and fled away.(he had asked us as well but we did not give him any money. we were saved. i'll describe ""the incident"" in detail below.) 
4. this guy is not picking up calls.

""the incident""

that particular day mr. z was very friendly towards us and built a good relationship. (so friendly we thought he wants to get into our pants. there was a creepy vibe about it. only later we knew why.) later that evening my flatmate went out with her boyfriend and i was alone at house. this guy bangs our door at 10:30 pm and asks if my flatmate is there and even when i said no he entered my home. i felt really unsafe about when he entered the house. he asked me if i can lend him 50k, there has been an emergency in the family to which i said no and then he started asking me to check if my flatmate has it. i told him i'll talk to her and he insited on me calling her right at that moment. i said i will let him know in an hour and he needed to leave. he kept calling me till 1am that night even though i had told him no. he called me again the next morning and i responded telling him that i have already said no. we do not have money and we rather pay rent monthly than right now for 2 months. this ended here. 

update 3 

1. mr. r has taken care of electricity issues of the property. 
2. he is making new rent agreements for all the tenants, keeping everything as is.
3. also we got to know that mr. z has taken bulk rent from 3 of apartment tenants, which add upto 23 l."

reddit,2024-09-14 14:43:51,"felt like i'm on another planet going out of my house after two weeks of working from home i was a little bit sick and didn't want to squander my limited sick leaves so decided to work from home for two weeks. the difference is night and day. 

earlier, i used to work in hybrid shifts of two days working from the office in a week. but never had a chance to experience a long continuous duration of working from home for 2 full weeks.

2 weeks of no chaos, full silence, nobody there to bother you, no shitty roads, no traffic, no honking, no cows or dogs or cats pooping on the road, no beggars or scammers, no terrible air quality, no hustle and scuffle and bustle of delhi, no pathetic roads filled with potholes, no trash on the street - nothing. it symbolically felt like living in a heaven. 

and after two weeks of working from home, now going out feels like night and day again. as they say - there is no middle ground in india. you either love it or you absolutely hate it. you're back to the chaos, shitty streets, cow poop on streets, terrible roads, pathetic air quality, trash everywhere, overpopulation everywhere, spitting on the roads everywhere, urinating everywhere, unorganised chaos everywhere and it feels like a post apocalyptic hell again. 

no wonder why shitty bosses/companies don't want people to work from home. you not only save money from avoiding commuting but most importantly you don't have to see everything bad being thrown at your face every single day. not sure what the situation with other major cities is but i speculate it's pretty much the same. delhi has become an absolute shithole from a beautiful city which it was when i was going up. tbh, if i wasn't too broke, i would have gone to any other major city or maybe even tier 2/3 city."

reddit,2024-09-18 23:38:35,"how do you get hired as a fresher outside college? [rant] one of my cousins graduated from electrical engineer this year and couldn't land a job in the college placements (there weren't many companies and it was a tier 2 college). 

she's trying hard to land something off campus since june and it's been a frustrating journey. she wanted to initially break into one of the core electrical companies but given how difficult it is to get something in core companies, she's started looking at it firms as well with no luck. came across lots of hiring scams as well. the job portals of typical it companies suck. 

are there better to ways to find a job outside college as a fresher? what has worked for you folks?"

reddit,2024-09-19 11:01:04,"deposit not yet return hi, all people i have a problem with my landlord not yet returning my deposit even after getting a new tenant..
so here’s the story i shift in a flat back in april 8th 2024 (gave some money as a token amount) but there was a problem with water, too hot in room even with fan on , food problem (i was eating from outside and haven’t bought much kitchen items)
so i told the landlord that let’s make a agreement but they were being delay after i sent all my details. days went by and on 27/28th april i told my landlord that i moving/ shifting, but back then i didn’t know the rules for moving from a flat ( tell the landlord 3 months prior ) but we sat down and make a deal that take the rent for the may 2024 and it was all set and told me that “the deposit amount isn’t ready yet but will be when i got a new tenant”. months went by until i call at the end of june and ask about it that the amount is ready but they have in cash and they’re out of state.again call them up on aug but still haven’t back yet..call once again on sept 8th and we talk on the phone told to come by next sunday 15th..went there, call them for like 8-9 times not picking up 
so i was went directly to the tenant (the room where i live earlier) i ask him when did he came here (room) and i was shocked to know that he was there already back from may/ june and yesterday (wednesday) i went to the landlord home but was locked from outside and even got a new tenant again and call them still haven’t pickup the call and to me it seems like they have another land/ house somewhere but i have no idea..i’m not from around here and i don’t wanna make a big scene by complaining to the police and all..so what should i do? 
i was thinking and the safest thing that came to my mind is to go directly to the 2 tenants and ask them to transfer the oct rent on my account..need some help here cause i’m out of all options and i do have the proof for the amount that i transferred via paytm just incase.."

**difficulty in filing a complaint? call this ngo for assistance**

*it has an 'army' of 10,000 volunteers across bengaluru*

a year old ngo in bengaluru is gaining in popularity for helping out citizens in situations big and small. these include filing firs, finding missing persons and pets, reporting cybercrimes, organising public campaigns, and arranging blood donors and mechanics-for free.

the ngo is called broseph foundation and it has 10,000 volunteers across bengaluru. they have a smaller base in chennai, hyderabad, and pune as well.

its founder dushyant dubey says they may not be successful in resolving all problems but their main aim is to assist people and offer hope that they are ""not alone and helpless"".

the 33-year-old quit his marketing career last year to become a full-time social worker. he had already been volunteering for causes like tribal welfare and education, and was also involved in covid-19 relief work. his friends used to teasingly call him st broseph, an internet slang for a brother one can always turn to.

a reddit post inspired this ngo. he shared, ""three years ago, i wrote on a reddit group that if anybody needed any help in bengaluru, they could reach out to me. i was flooded with messages. people complained of landlord issues, phone snatching and criminal intimidation. women faced stalking and also threats of their photos being leaked online. others had water and power issues.""

dushyant dubey (standing, left) at his ngo in indiranagar. his team comprises six full-time members and 10,000 volunteers.

dubey looked sleepy when metrolife visited his office in indiranagar on wednesday. he had stayed up until 2.30 am to meet a woman who had allegedly faced sexual assault. ""she wanted to know how to take the complaint forward. we try to attend cases 24/7,""he said.

janhavi desai testified to the round-the-clock operation. last year, she had ""called broseph at 2 am"" to track down a person who she feared was suicidal. ""he contacted the police and the guy was found,"" she recalled. today, janhavi has quit her job at a think-tank and oversees cases related to mental health and animal rescue here.

many volunteers are people whom dubey's ""army"" had helped out at some point. today, they are creating databases of ambulances, local police stations and bbmp offices, and affordable mental health services. they accompany people to police stations, government offices, and courts.

earlier, when a case came up. dubey's team would tap into their contacts in ngos, citizen groups, law enforcement and civic offices, and personal and professional networks to find help. ""now, we have figured out the official process,"" he said.

dubey is also reading law books to assist victims better. he explains, ""this january, a gay person was tortured when he went on a 'date' in tavarekere. the police had only filed a case for assault and criminal intimidation. when he approached me, i realised he had also been robbed, wrongfully confined, and subjected to humiliation. we rewrote his complaint and submitted it to the police. they added a few new charges. the accused was apprehended,"" he said.

towards the end of our interview, a woman from hsr layout called him, seeking help to restore her social media account that had been hacked. details on [broseph.in](http://broseph.in)"

reddit,2024-09-29 01:44:09,"bangalore is a city of power cuts for some reason, bangalore experiences so. many. power cuts. all the time, and especially when it rains. whether it rains for 2 minutes or 2 hours, there'll be a loooong power cut. 

if you go on twitter and search for people tagging bescom, you'll find an insane number of people complaining every minute of every day about a power cut in some area of another. 

and i say this with this knowledge that regular power cuts happen in every major/minor city across the country. but it's ridiculously frequent in bangalore. i've done my research and have the firsthand experience to make this claim. and the number of buildings not providing a power backup makes this an ever bigger frustration for renters like me. 

(of course i'm going to get downvoted for saying this even though i didn't say anything objectively wrong. but i just had to say this out loud because i'm sitting here with no electricity for 3+ hours, trying to sleep after a long day. 🙏🏻) 


edit: people claiming ""no power cut in my area"", that's good for you. please try to sympathize with somebody struggling with a problem, even if you don't have to face it yourself."

reddit,2024-09-29 12:03:02,"don't take life for granted well i want to share my life story till now

sharing you my story till now fyi - i am a guy

birth to 2 years old - i was born prematurely at 5 months , from what my mom said drs said you can take him home  but he won't live.
according to my mom she fought day &amp; night to well save me...

2 years to 12 - in these time there was no health issues that i know of. i was a trouble maker like i would climb under construction building 3 stories high just to fly a kite. my father got extremely rich during this time,and overall time was good untill the end of my 12th birthday when my father got a drinking problem.

12-14years - my father used to come late everynight  and my mom &amp; me couldn't sleep almost every night.
he began losing his wealth and his mind too. he left his job and intentionally destroyed our whole family savings. he got diagnosed with liver failure by then for some reason he was sober these , i remember myself telling to him to live for my sake he said it's too late , he died a month later

14-20 years - with my father dead and only my mom's last 3 lakh rs, she put it on mis for a princely monthly income of rs 1400, we would eat potato curry and rice on maximum days in a month baring a few in some days when my grandfather came and brould something good. in this time i would buy a old computer to learn it.
begged my mom to give me internet she did give me but the net was of local cable of rs 150/month 100 hours a month 15 kbps,🤣🤣🤣. this time i learned pc hardware repair from web articles, and i started earning something and paid for my own college and also at home, bought a mobile.

20-25years - joined a company that seemed okay , salary was increasing my mom and me used to eat good food everyday and i bought an ac for her money was in bank , mom was pestering me to get married good times.

26-28 years got married my mom was happy but i was not as my current wife cannot tolerate sex pain🤣🤣🤣

28- 33 years i get neck pain now and then so i got and mri and wouldn't you know it they found a rare malformation on my neck and brain area which was critical. reffered me to a neurosurgeon, he said to get immediate surgery or risk being paraplegic but i didn't have any symptoms dr said in this case their is no symptoms only effect. so  i arranged funds as my sweet employer didn't even enroll me to any health plans like esi he did have that but didn't give to me , he said"" you are so bubbly  never thought you would have health issues"" so i managed funds and i got the surgery...and i am thinking when will i lose bodily function  as the failure rate of this surgery is high.
i got into depression and the happiness is gone of all things my employer would just withhold my salary everymonth for me to state how much i have worked.
i was going to work with a neckbrace everyday and there would be days where he would scheme me to stand 4-5 hours which would cause me pain.
got many other job offers but relative said don't take as you are sort of handicapped and can't work anywhere, to them my great employer is god 

my wife has started their typical "" my life is ruined from the day i married you almost everyday now.

33 to corona- at holi my mom was complaining of abdominal pain so took her to hospital , dr said both her kidneys have failed she will go soon, couldn't believe it as whe was ok no complains the day i took her to hospital she only cooked for for the day...my unds were almost finished took her to a govt hospital and she too died. my life was blank from this point on as i thought nothing can happen to my iron lady my mother.


corona period - well my godly employer decided to terminate just my job in the whole office

after my mom is gone my wife and i used to have regular fights about not having a baby, i told her how is it my fault when can't tolerate sex....she said if you were a man i would be pregnant 🤣🤣🤣🤣

2022 till now - i was adamant to try for a baby so i began our journey of ivf fertility clinics. money was spent like water in the pursuit of parental happiness,
deep inside i felt like worst is coming for me so get that baby out soon🤣🤣🤣. after spending almost a fortune
the doctor said she is out of embryos and after this many trials chance of conceiving are low. she said there is new procedure to try but it would cost close to 10 lacs
i said i don't have the money she said she could arrange 
emi financing, as husband &amp; wife we were beyond broken almost on the brink of divorce.
then one day she said she missed her period, i didn't bother thought it was a fluke as before but after 10 days i did the pee test, it was positive for pregnancy. god has finally listened to us. i immediately changed drs and i made it my target to bring the baby home as i knew this was my only chance. after a roller coster ride the time came and her water broke and my baby was to be delivered 2 weeks early. i finnally welcomed my daughter in this world and the day was like dream of dreams.
i was living the perfect life thinking about her future schools and other things.

few months ago i went to my doctor to tell him to give me a usg to see the status of my fatty liver, i was confident of fatty liver stage decrease as i controlled on foods, he said you are paranoid go enjoy your life your are totally fit but i insisted on it.

so the day of the usg i will never forget the person doing the usg was scolding me that why do people like me do not do regular scans, i said if there is anything wrong he said report will be there.

on the report there is a liver mass and kidney mass, i immediately took that to my dr he said he suspects malignancy so get a ct.

i did a ct and the tumor on liver was benign but the kidney one is cancer. 
i did the surgery which was required but i have not been the same , i don't go to office , lost my focus in life, eating out my savings...i have no confidence on future

this is a true story of mine thanks for reading ..."

reddit,2024-10-02 03:46:01,"the fake pride of indians: a call for awareness and responsibility i’m an indian living abroad, and i used to take immense pride in my country. however, after traveling to several other countries, especially in the west, i’ve come to realize that india, while rich in history and culture, is far behind in many aspects that make a society function smoothly. we, as indians, often pride ourselves on our culture and moral values, believing that we are unique or superior in these areas. but in reality, we seem to lack basic civic sense and social responsibility.

let’s start with the simple issue of cleanliness and hygiene. many people in india seem to have no problem littering on the streets, throwing trash in rivers, spitting in public places, or even defecating in the open. it’s common to see piles of garbage on roadsides, and despite the constant calls for cleanliness, the situation hasn’t improved much. how can we claim to have great values when we don’t even respect our own environment?

another example is the way religion is practiced. i’m not from the hindu religion, but i deeply respect hinduism. however, the way some people misuse religion is shameful. polluting rivers that are considered sacred, turning festivals into sources of massive environmental damage, and causing public nuisance in the name of faith – is this what indian culture stands for? it feels like blind faith without responsibility. we need to stop hiding behind religion and start focusing on personal and communal responsibility.

the indian media, unfortunately, is not helping. instead of highlighting important issues like cleanliness, environmental degradation, and the lack of basic civic education, it has become a tool for political propaganda. indian media is more interested in sensationalism, focusing on what benefits the politicians rather than what benefits the people. there's little space for constructive criticism or self-reflection. instead, the youth is being fed a distorted sense of patriotism.

speaking of the youth, many are so brainwashed by this false sense of pride that they’ll spam comments like “proud to be indian” on foreign videos just because an indian song or actor is featured. while there’s nothing wrong with being proud of our heritage, this blind nationalism is misplaced. what are we proud of when we don’t even follow the basic principles of civic behavior? we don’t know how to behave in public spaces, we don’t keep our surroundings clean, and personal hygiene is often neglected. it’s disturbing to think that people serve food while lacking proper hygiene practices. basic hygiene should not be a privilege, but a standard.

another glaring issue in india is the traffic. most drivers do not follow traffic rules, and the roads are chaotic with constant honking and reckless driving. it’s not just dangerous but reflects a lack of respect for public order and discipline. even some people who move abroad continue to drive like maniacs, as if they’re still in india, disregarding the rules and norms of the country they now live in. it’s not a matter of population density alone; cities like tokyo, which are far more crowded, still manage to have order because people there follow rules, respect public spaces, and have civic awareness.

i’m not trying to spread hate or negativity with this post. my intention is to raise awareness and make us realize that we are living in a bubble of fake pride. we keep calling ourselves the “future superpower” or “the best country,” but we are far from that if we don’t even know how to maintain basic hygiene, follow traffic laws, or respect public spaces. population is one issue, but education—especially civic education—is another.

if we are truly proud to be indian, then it’s time to let go of this fake sense of pride. instead, we need to take responsibility for making india great, starting with small changes. we should stop blaming the government and politicians for everything and look at what we, as citizens, can do. yes, corruption exists, and yes, the government often fails in its duties, but that doesn’t absolve us from doing our part. we must take responsibility for keeping our surroundings clean, following the law, and educating ourselves and others on basic civic duties.

real pride doesn’t come from chanting slogans or spamming “proud to be indian” comments online. it comes from action—by improving ourselves and making our country a better place to live. it’s time to wake up from the bubble of fake pride and work toward a real, tangible improvement."

request you to read it, if you can.  
not posting from original reddit account to prevent doxxing and retaliation  
  
\[rapido\] i want to keep it as concise as possible, so i was travelling in auto to hsbc raj bhavan road.  
pre ride kept asking for fare. after 2 kms in the ride said fare shown to me is 224. i immediately smelled fake app screen scam. \[ [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uber-fake-fare-screen-scam-company-issues-issues-important-tips-to-spot-and-avoid/articleshow/109852995.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uber-fake-fare-screen-scam-company-issues-issues-important-tips-to-spot-and-avoid/articleshow/109852995.cms) \]  
  
just 10 minute before ride ends, i asked him to stop ride in front of me. he puts the phone in airplane mode then for no reason, starts staring at me very viciously.

fare comes out to 194 as expected, he starts haggling a lot for 200 saying only 6rs more. i refuse. then stop the video ( shouldnt have ). i pay him via upi, then start taking photo of his back plate ( it didnt match the one shown in the app ) 

he held my hand tighly, thank god a security guard 1m away intervened. he kept shouting in hindi"" what is your problem? what are you doing?"" again and again  
i rushed back to hsbc bank inside, i was scare but took this video of him while guard was stopping him. god knows if guard was not there, he would have forced me to delete the photo beated me, snatched my phone and what else. maybe even caused caos by false accusations. i am a skinny male 26 along so went in.

the reason more people are not reporting , maybe even giving his fake app screen fare is to avoid getting killed or beaten but i was lucky, you might not be.

i am attaching all the media except 1 video ( mods see message at last).  
rapido called after the tweet and ""assured"" action.

rapido doesnt mask phone numbers, god knows how unsafe it is for women. as he directly called my number. also they know the pickup and drop locations so they know where you usually are, therefore for others who cant beat the shit out of them cant defend themselves.

i would like to request you to kindly share it as it may happen to you or someone you know. all media content is here, you guys can see https://imgur.com/a/rapido-auto-beat-me-hwqp2rk. feel free to reshare it to other subreddits or social media platforms, i would greatly appreciate it.just want to spread awareness  
  
message to mods: i have the original video from 10 minutes before ride end to him haggling for fare where his face is clearly visible with audio, if you want i can send it over to you so you can verify and comment for its authenticity."

reddit,2024-10-05 21:22:17,"happened in rohtak, haryana.  we bought this moped for my mom. 4 days ago and my father took it today as he had not tried it since the day we bought it. and when it was parked on the street outside his office some children aged between 10-15 years came and took the rear view mirrors and brake levers with them probably because they saw a new moped and thought these parts would we worth something. we got to know who did it from the cctv cameras. they were not positioned onto the activa but they were seen coming and taking the parts with them in the video. it’s of no use to report them as they live in slums and pick garbage from the street. 
they have damaged the parts from inside in order to get the levers in good shape. 
fucking thieves they would get only 200-300₹ for it i guess but they damaged my new activa. 

is there something i could have done to avoid it? 
what are your thoughts about this? 
i recorded this video after my father got home. 
he tied a wire to the broken brake parts in order to control the moped to home."
reddit,2024-10-05 23:01:16,"are you too superstitious about god? first thing first, i am not an atheist who don't believe in god and this post is not to disbelief any religios thing. 

context

why this came to my mind.

my gf is from brahmin family. so she takes literally everything from religious perspective. she eats pure veg (no onion garlic also). she always talks about if you do this this god will be angry, if you do this this god will be happy. and also about astrology a lot.

my take

as i said i am a non-vegetarian and not an atheist and i do believe in god. i believe whatever nature gave us everything is god. the air (vayu), fire (agni), water (ganga), sun, moon everything. we worship everything in hindu culture and i think all should be worshipped as these are essential for any living beings and we should be thankful to whatever we have.

problem 

now the thing is people get too superstitious about these things and they literally don't live their life at fullest as they bound themselves to do something which is religious to keep god happy. so that there will be more wealth (laksmi) comes to them. 

philosophy 

everything is for mental peace. many people get relief talking to god and do stuffs to keep god happy indirectly themselves happy. but people always forget to be happy we should focus on our life too. do hardwork, be kind, always help others if required and if you capable. by this we will become good from inside not just for showing but you will feel really good. 

what's your take?"
reddit,2024-10-05 23:04:40,"few questions regarding cooking rice. so i am a virgin when it comes to cooking rice, but i think the time has come to finally lose it. i bought an electric rice cooker recently, and although the instructions are clear in the manual, i have few stuff i wanna know before it becomes a bad first time experience for me.

i will be cooking some kind of basmati rice.

1. some people have said that the rice should be soaked before cooking. if yes, then for how long?  
2. also, should i add salt to the water? during cooking phase or soaking phase(if soaking is required at all)  
3. which type of rice should i be using for regular use? the one i bought seems to be little bit costly. which should be fine, saw some cheaper ones as well, but definitely would prefer some better quality ones.  
4. how many grams of uncooked rice should i put in for 1 person? (would be eating it with dal and some vegetables/curries)

reddit,2024-10-06 19:33:10,"blusmart rant the whole usp of blusmart over uber was that if you pre-book a cab from airport, you get a cab at your time of landing and don’t have to wait. their whole pitch to investors was they’ll have lower cost of operation due to electric fleet and they can manage supply demand well due to the pre-booking model. now in order to drive up the volume of bookings made, they have introduced instant booking for which the entire supply demand has gone for a toss. had to wait for 35 mins at the airport after pre-booking to get a cab. what’s the point of a startup if you have to eventually become a copycat of uber?"

reddit,2024-10-07 20:42:37,"new scam on ola foods the delivery boy claims that the order was taken by someone else but the restaurant says that the order was taken by the delivery boy.

my food did not arrive and all of this is happening due to lack of a proper customer support system. 

ola's customers are getting scammed. and since this was the second time this happened  to me (and that too just within 30hrs) i visited the restaurant and called the delivery boy who claimed to still be waiting at the restaurant to collect my order. after he realized that i was at the restaurant, he cut the call and blocked my number. the delivery partners are scamming ola.  i am sure that i am not the only customer facing this issue. 

today when i went to a restaurant in koramangala with a friend, i saw 1 delivery boy walking out with a food package and he immediately called the customer and told him that someone else took the order.. i immediately understood that he was one of those scammers. he was wearing a black facemask (making him difficult to recognize) and was travelling in a an electric scooter similar to the yulu with no number plate (making him difficult to track). 

everyone kindly refrain from using the ola app to order food till they fix their customer support and delivery boy scam issues."

reddit,2024-10-08 15:12:04,"why do we struggle with basic civic sense in india? one thing that has been bothering me lately is how we, as a society, often overlook basic civic responsibilities. i’m sure we’ve all seen examples—people throwing garbage on the streets, spitting in public spaces, or casually jumping traffic signals. it’s frustrating to see, especially when many of these same people behave differently when they’re abroad. they follow the rules there, but back home, it seems like anything goes.

it makes me wonder: why do we lack such basic civic sense? is it because of poor education, weak enforcement of rules, or just a general mindset that public spaces aren’t ""our problem""? it’s not just about following rules; it’s about respecting the space we all share and realizing that small actions make a big difference.

what do you think? how do we change this attitude and create more awareness? i’d love to hear your thoughts and suggestions on how we can improve civic sense in our communities. let’s have a conversation about what we can do better, because if we don’t start caring about our surroundings, who will?"

reddit,2024-10-11 00:31:05,"bangalore is nice but..can we talk about this? i'm new to this city and the only thing that's been bothering me a lot is acne!

when i moved here back in august, it was all good and pretty fun actually.  but the problem started after a few weeks. acne. i started getting lots of it and it is getting worse!
i started observing everyone's skin around me and i was shocked! almost everyone has bad skin. some have way worse than i could imagine ever!

anyway, i went to see a doc regarding something else and raised this concern as well and her very first question was: have you recently moved in here? i was like yeah, a month now!
she was like yeah here the quality of water has worsened over 2-3 years. you have filtered water and rest we can't do much about it. 

i have started taking better care of my diet and drink as much water as i can but the result doesn't differ much. 

i have talked to a few of my colleagues who are native here and this guy told me that he has stopped washing his hair🥲 and another woman told me to not wash face or my body with tap water. 

i am left clueless now. i am a girl who never liked any moisturiser or skincare products but i have started with a moisturiser now. it obviously doesn't do anything but helps me calm a bit.

do you guys experience this too? please tell me if you have found a way to beat this virus man!

i am starting to hate the way i look now. i need to do something about this otherwise i can imagine my skin already covered with big dark spots! and it surely isn't much appealing! 

p.s.: its not a 'i hate this city' post. i really like this city and its people. very friendly and nice but every coin has 2 sides."

reddit,2024-10-11 12:58:10,"too many orders before i proceed to rant, i want to say i’m not good at my finances. i got a job an year back and have been enjoying my financial freedom ever since. at this point i’m able to buy things that i’ve always wanted, even the things i didn’t have when i was a kid, like a nerf gun, and a cool rc car. i bought them out of pure childishness, it made my inner child really happy. but lately i have ordered too many adult products as well(not what you think) like bed sheets, curtains ,an electric rice cooker and other things i can’t keep track of. 

i just received a message saying “if you don’t update the location we will return the order (link)”. i know it’s a scam but for 10 min i just scrolled past 5 products in orders list. i’m not able to keep track of my packages and every time a delivery guy passes me while i’m leaving work, i go back to check if it’s mine and disappointed when it’s not. has anyone been in this situation ever ?"
reddit,2024-10-11 17:41:23,"what kind of a purifier do you use? namaskara. channagidira?

i have a question. i use an kent mineral ro water purifier for a family of 4. i bought it 8 years ago. i had to spend additional money on extended warranty because the motherboard in the top unit used to fail like clockwork after every 6 months. their water candles were unnecessarily expensive and i used buy the ones sold in avenue road and replace them. 

the problem is that the machine needs to be to kept switched on. it automatically shuts down when the water is full in the 5l pressurised tank. if switched off, a kind of vacuum developes in the pipes and the machine takes a long time to start filtering the water. now, there is a lot of waste water being released when the water is getting purified, which i collect to water plants in my house and the apartment, and collect some more to wash my car. 

**however, i am still not happy with the fact that this machine is wasting a lot of water.** 

i wanted to know what kind of water purifier you guys are using and what are its repair and service costs and if it wastes a lot of water."

reddit,2024-10-12 23:11:09,"was asked to shift the city to bangalore. and then they went extra miles to fire me. hey guys!

i'm still in shock and trying my best to avoid a nervous breakdown. i was living in gurgaon and was looking for a job there. i got an offer from one of the oldest global it companies and was called here. i changed my location and started working here in july. i was finally relieved and everything was going well. i started clearing my debts and took a flat with 1 lac advance and 40k rent. called my family here. i had a probation of six months. last thursday, i was suddenly told that my last working day is monday. i felt a sudden electric shock inside. the same day i got a cylinder connection. i bought a geyser the same morning. ""60% of the salary goes to emi and debts. how would i manage after this?"", i started wondering. there was a pin-drop silence. i regained my senses and asked them how's this possible? my probation period was of 6 months! they told me that they changed my probation period without informing me and they are not satisfied with my performance. i asked them what did i do? can't recall any such things. i even told them that i did not receive any such intimation. they said i was informed in the meetings. but they were just casual instructions! i am in design field and you always receive some inputs or comments. i didn't know this was going to cost me my job. they even sent a mail a week back full of lies about my performance a week back. they told me to treat it as a warning but it was just a feedback mail! 

i broke down in that moment. on the camera. i told them i have a family. a week back i paid the advance plus rent. i requested them some more time. another chance or anything. they said this is a final decision. i explained them it's a miscommunication and i am a good performer but they didn't listen at all. 

i know this happens often but it was one of the orders computer companies and a global brand and there were no layoffs recently. i am still in shock.


tldr: management changed my notice period to 3 months at the end of 3 months without telling me and suddenly told me that i am fired . i didn't plan it and i don't know how i will i survive now."

we do have backups but if i am between a client call and power goes off then i m fucked!
because it takes 5 to 15 mins for power to come back and router to restart.  phone internet is not reliable at our low floor.

i know many are facing this problem but in my line where i deal with international clients,  if we show signs of poor internet infrastructure then we are fucked!

recently,  we started this exercise in our whatsapp group to broadcast power cuts to get an idea which areas still have power. as of now it seems jp nagar, btm are neglected much more."

reddit,2024-10-19 09:10:31,"apologists for our lack of civic sense, poor urban/general planning and low quality infrastructure - please go see china one of the most common reasons i hear from many indians for explaining why we lack civic sense, why we just can't have good things, why our cities and towns are so poorly planned, why our infrastructure (despite how many ever roads and bridges are built) is in a constant state of disrepair, and why we are who we are: ""overpopulation""/""too few resources"".

for those who subscribe to this theory, which i think is nothing more than an excuse - please go see china once in your life.

for all the populist media chest thumping our government likes to do about how india is the next china - no we are not. we are not 20 or 30 years behind them, we are 50 to 60 years behind them.

more to the point - china has just as many people as india. we only recently crossed them in population. in their hyper growth phase, they always had more people than we did. yet somehow, they developed cities that were well planned, infrastructure that is gargantuan and better than most western countries, and raised the general standard of living.

how did they do this? because their people actually subscribe to following a system, being considerate (at least much more than us) to each other, putting their head down and working hard while not making excuses, and being held accountable at all levels, for the most part.

china is not perfect by any means - it is just an example of how we should not make excuses for ourselves due to whatever constraints we have. china also started from basically nothing, 60 years ago, just like we did. for us, like them, our people are our biggest resource. but our people's mentality is the biggest problem that we have. we are self centered and will step on each other for personsal gain. those who point to corruption in the system and in government - where do you think that comes from? the lack of accountability, the rampant cronyism, the gunda-giri of many of those present in office: it's a reflection of the people.

we cannot be a truly mature, developed country until we grow out of our petty, selfish and small minded mindset."

reddit,2024-10-19 22:56:46,"bescom cut my electricity when my bill was already paid i came home today to find out that my electricity had been cut (fuse was removed), and everything in my fridge was ruined, to the extreme that i might need to throw it out.

my security guard told me that they had removed the fuse on 12th of october, which makes no sense since i had already paid my previous bill on 20th september. the new bill had been generated on 11th october, and due date was 25th, and i had already paid that as well around 2-3 days ago.

i have my bill and payment receipts on the bescom app for everything. is there any way or hope in complaining? if so, where can i complain? my entire day and next couple of days will he ruined, and i might also need to rent out a fridge if the stench just does not go away. 

--

edit: thanks guys. i faced that asd issue some 3-4 months ago and had paid it back then.
what i suspect is that where i live, if someone else's fuse gets removed by bescom, the security guard removes someone else's fuse who is out of station. and he obviously will never admit it, but he had offered it to us back when ours was removed and we had refused so i would not put it past him."

reddit,2024-10-20 04:33:52,"queries on applying ekhata for myself for my bmrda plot  i own a plot in one of the gated communites on chandapur-anekal main road near vbhc apartments. i know that this falls under bmrda . i bought this 12 years ago through bank loan. from then on i did not pay any property taxes. i now want to go apply for e-khata. i have few queries regarding this:

1. what are the detailed mandatory steps i need complete before applying for e-khata? appreciate any websites you guide me here to complete these tasks by myself.
2. list of all documents needed to apply for ekhata.
3. steps for e-khata. any website where i can apply for myself. whats the fee? how many days will it take for me to get ekhata after properly submitting all documents from point 2 here.
4. problems i run into if i do these steps by myself if any (instead of approaching an agent for these tasks). you know, want to do such government tasks all by myself to break the jinx of oooh...its a government job and i need to go around circles to get one all by myself and i want to avoid hefty fees as well charged by those agents. 
5. any other minutiae if i missed in the above points. 

highly appreciate for your guidances here on my query. and thank you in advance."

reddit,2024-10-20 13:23:48,"horrible experience with ola cabs and harassment from the driver. so, yesterday we booked a cab, the cab came to our apartment in horrible condition, it was raining and there was bad traffic, it took forever for us to reach due to bad traffic and due to rain, it was also night time, the cab was in extremely poor condition like it was very old and in completely bad state, after a lot of struggle, the driver reached to a particular location and said, that this is the location and please drop here, we told him that this is not the location, and he immediately started shouting and started behaving in rowdy manner, we were two women and two senior citizen and a small baby, we told him to take to the particular location and also told that we would pay him for that after arguing a lot that he has brought us to a wrong location and he was not agreeing, but he said he lost a drive due to us and that he won't take us to that location and also said we had to pay extra, we clearly told him this is not the location and that we had entered correct location and he was dropping us elsewhere, he told to get out of the car and that he doesn't want money, since he said he didn't want money and he dropped in wrong location, we dropped off and he started taking our picture, this was noticed by my family and then again he called telling that he will drop us to the right location, my family confronted him about taking the picture, he again started shouting and behaving in extremely rowdyish manner, i felt scared at his behaviour and started recording his video, he noticed that i was recording the video and decided that he will record the video and again started shouting, since ola doesn't have a phone number and we have to contact through messaging, we couldn't do anything as he was creating a scene, every second, when he started recording video, i felt damn scared the way he was behaving and opened the door in traffic, some auto passed there and there was sound, but nothing happened to me thankfully, noticing this he again started bullying and harassing us telling that we have damaged his car and came on road, my family and him started arguing and people around there started supporting us, the child started crying, telling that she is getting pain in her heart and feeling very scared due to rowdy behaviour of driver, also we were running here and there in rain as she was feeling unsafe near cab area due to fights where there was shade to protect from rain, that too in night time, i tried to contact some relatives for help, the people around tried to help us, he again started harassing telling let's go to station acting as though we did wrong to him and we paid a little extra money than what had come in app, due to his harassment. we left the place immediately booking auto ride from uber and rapido, and were in complete shock state due to his abuse that too women, senior citizen and kid, later we noticed that horrible problem with ola maps, that the location gets detected at two different places, one where, it actually is and one in some mall where it is not there. it was complete traumatizing feeling, and made us extremely unsafe during the ride. ola has deteriorated in quality, pathetic cabs, rowdy drivers, unsafe feeling, no customer support phone number. he asked to pay money in cash, and said he didn't have a scanner."

reddit,2024-10-23 21:19:43,"we needed a lot of rain during the dry spell and heat wave, but with so much rain now, the city has become a total mess.  i love bangalore, i love the people, i love the pleasant weather too. but the heavy rains in the past few days have wreaked so much havoc here that it’s incomprehensible. it’s literally exposed how terrible our civic bodies’ coordination is due to which our infrastructure is absolutely horrendous. garbage dumps literally everywhere, unreal waterlogging, overflowing sewer drains, stench everywhere, silt everywhere and traffic that barely moved. 

a trip which usually takes maybe 45 minutes even in peak traffic took me two hours. even the shortcuts were jam packed and the roads had massive potholes in them. 

stay safe, guys. plan your routes well. 
may bangalore become better again."

reddit,2024-10-24 08:06:01,"garbage disposal during office work days mon-fri i really wanted to know as to how people who go to office every day dispose your garbage.  
i mean of course some high level people might have their workers get the chore done, or the apartments help as a part of maintenance.  
but normal people, how do you?   
i was comfortable during hybrid, since i would throw the garbage once in two days when working from home when the bbmp guy arrives(very rare; still...)  
but now ever since 5 days wfo, i am so confused as to how to tackle this problem.  
i try to dispose them early in the morning before going to work near some of the bbmp garbage trucks parking stations.  
but even they scold me saying no to throw here.  
i don't know what to do now.  
i don't like to throw it just anywhere like most people do. i can but... i don't want to.( we shouldn't be doing so)."

just one of the many great advantages of living in the great city that is bangalore. 

would be great if as many people could re tweet this to bring to notice the failure of the state government.
tc palya bangalore, margondanahalli where garbage is thrown on the ground and while there is a building whose waste water is being released into an open ground that always overflows into the road and mixes with garbage. 

there are at least 3 schools and several apartments in this road. 
the recent rains have made it worse and it almost feels like an incident needs to happen for anybody to take notice. 
until then we just continue to pay our 30% taxes."

reddit,2024-10-28 19:57:16,"is bbmp permission required to trim branches of a tree hovering above a house ? we have two trees in front of our home (kaadu badaam). they are on the pavement. they were planted in 1998 by us only when there were no bs tree cutting extortionist laws back then. they have now grown tall and wide.   
  
problem 1)   
this kind of tree becomes bare twice in a year with a truck load of leaves for us to sweep &amp; clear, but drops small flower and fruits almost all year round. it has now become a big problem cleaning the front yard everday ! also our home painted only sometime back has developed dark patches due to these tree leaves and fruits rotting.  


problem 2)   
above all its fallen leaves block rain water pipes. during recent intense rains (happened few days back) water could not flow down from the 1st floor terrace so entered inside thru the terrace door, flooded part of our home. took 3 hours and 10\~12 buckets to remove the flood water. when it starts raining its difficult for me to sleep for fear of water coming inside.

  
problem 3)   
when there are fruits, lots of bats visit at night, to eat it, and do no.2 on our building. this not only makes the house look dirty with dark patches all around but also we fear diseases. (like covid ?)

  
the truth is we are actually fond of this tree and dont want to cut it. but we want to keep the branches trimmed so that it doesnt cause the above problems, and we can live peacefully.

**how to go about keeping the tree branches trimmed ?**   
is it a problem if i prune the small weak branches (not big ones) which are over my house every 3 months ? if i am able to do this then i can escape the above said problems."

reddit,2024-10-31 21:45:37,"a homeowner who makes 14 months of rental income every year. i'm currently renting in a multi-floor independent building owned by an advocate/lawyer who rents out eight units. the rental agreement is pretty awful, but i won't dive into the details right now.

he markets the homes at around ₹5,000 less than similar ones in the area, using a lot of sweet talk to attract tenants. however, once you move in, things get tough:

* he adds unnecessary charges that were hidden in the rental agreement.
* the lift gets turned off randomly, often citing fake power cuts.
* he even turned off the lift for a pregnant tenant as a punishment for another tenant.
* he tries to enter tenants' homes for inspections.
* the building gate is locked 24/7, requiring us to use a common key every time we leave.
* he constantly boasts about his connections with local politicians.
* he doesn’t provide the 200 units of free government electricity that tenants should receive.
* he also doesn’t give us the electricity and water bills.

after six months (the lock-in period), he makes it difficult for tenants to stay and charges one month’s rent from the deposit when they leave. this cycle repeats every six months, allowing him to pocket seven months' rent.

given that he's crafted a tight rental agreement to cover his behavior, is there anything i can do to ensure future tenants know what they’re getting into? there's no online presence or reviews for this place either.

even if this post doesn't lead anywhere, i just thought i'd get it out of my chest."

reddit,2024-11-02 12:16:59,"bangalore's biggest traffic disaster bangalore's largest traffic crisis is yet to present it self. there were definitely opportunities to solve it before it occurred. i am not talking about silk board jn. the long-standing congestion at silk board will see some relief once the flyover on the opposite side opens. even with one side being open, it has solved a large portion  of traffic problems.

i am concerned about what is unfolding just outside the new horizon engineering college on the outer ring road, the road in front of new horizon college gate is planned to be widened in to a 150 foot wide highway and extended all the way to kolar. despite this road being in the works for 20 years, local politicians haven't made meaningful efforts to improve its design at the spot where the road merges in to orr. adding to the problem, the new highway won’t have an underpass where it meets orr, as metro pillars are already in place. in a few years, this area is set to become the world's worst bottleneck, where a 150 foot wide highway will converge into a service road - what a sad outcome !  given that there will be no provision of underpass, entry from the orr on the road will also be difficult and will clog other spots on the orr. 

just imagine all the traffic from whitefield and varthur that will congest this very spot. a few tech parks were initially planned along this route in varthur, but they were canceled after investors withdrew, citing concerns over the future traffic problems at this spot. eventually, developers opted to build residential flats instead, and buyers are eagerly purchasing these properties with the assumption that road will be constructed soon.  is anyone more gullible than flat buyers who believe this road will be completed soon? several sections of the road have already been completed, but private landowners are hindering further progress. the bda is overseeing the construction, yet, surprisingly, both the bbmp and the forest department have raised concerns about land acquisition as well. so the road is disconnected at several locations.  it is proposed that bda will build this road till kolar district under cdp/rmp plan and from there state government will take the road forward to other places."

reddit,2024-11-02 22:34:42,"lenskart has gone downhill - never ordering again.  i've been a repeat customer with lenskart for a while now. i know their lens quality isn't great, but i wear my specs all the time, and they’re one of the only places with rimless frames i like. but seriously, this company has gone to absolute garbage over the past couple of years.

to start, let’s talk about their so-called ""premium"" soft green cases. it's a scam, plain and simple. they’re more like flimsy wallets than cases. just the tiniest pinch, and my specs are damaged. what are they thinking? it’s like they designed it specifically to make you need another order sooner.

and don’t even get me started on their ""owndays"" line, which they’re hyping up as some premium japanese brand. turns out, it’s basically just a rebadged version of john jacobs. i mean, what kind of rebranding nonsense is that? i recently placed three orders, and i’ve had to return every single one of them.

i’m done. i’m never going to order from lenskart again"

reddit,2024-11-06 08:49:02,"sheer lack of civic sense i'm a north indian living in bangalore for the past 2 years. shifted to the hulimavu area a few months back. at my layout's entrance there is always a big heap of garbage which people throw at night. this happens daily. dogs and cattle in attempts to eat from inside the plastic bags, litter everything around, and the area is always stinking and buzzing with flies. the worst part is the garbage van comes everyday in the morning but these uncouth people have to throw it out on the street for some demented reason. i have tried reasoning with a couple of them when i saw them doing it while i was returning a little late in the evening. in return i was told not to interfere in local matters. what can i do to help?

edit1: after repeated requests to the colony people, i guess some people understood that it has to be stopped. they had the adjoining wall decorated with paintings of respected famous people and erected a flag pole with 3 stairs beside it. we even had a small republic day ceremony there on sunday. 
all is not lost yet, i guess it takes someone to initiate something good and keep at it to improve things."

reddit,2024-11-07 11:17:57,"india is heading towards climate change disaster india needs to stop trying to be the next china and focus on the real challenges we're facing, primarily climate change. most of our population depends on farming—what will happen when climate change causes crops to fail? more people will depend on the government for survival, and the situation could become dire very quickly.

our cities are already in crisis, with high pollution and extreme temperatures, and it's only getting worse. summers in delhi can reach a scorching 50°c, and november is so warm that acs are still running. in 5 to 10 years, those modern stadiums and world-class buildings will mean nothing in the face of these conditions.

our entire competitive advantage has been a large, low-cost labor force, but in the long run, this won’t matter. automation is set to disrupt our workforce, and local production in developed countries will cut into our economy. even blue-collar jobs are disappearing as companies make 10x the profit with fewer employees.

we’re celebrating deforestation in the name of progress and capitalism without realizing the long-term harm. even china has recognized this and is leading the world in solar energy and electric vehicles, while we lag far behind.

the harsh truth is that we don’t want to face these realities. we know firecrackers damage people’s lungs, but nobody does anything. our only priority seems to be hitting an 8% growth rate to attract foreign investment, even if it compromises our well-being."

reddit,2024-11-08 10:12:33,"what do you all do with your old clothes? namaskaaram bengaluru! recently found myself going through my wardrobe and realise 60-70% of the clothes in there are stuff i don't wear (i end up wearing the same 5-6 outfits over and over)

really wanted to get rid of the extra stuff. some clothes are really battered, and have holes in them, so not good for wearing at all.
some of them are a tad bit faded but are still in good shape structurally. 
what do you all do with yours?
are there places where i can recycle/upcycle them? are there places where i can donate? or is the only solution to throw them in the garbage (which feels very wasteful)
any insight is appreciated 👍🏼"

reddit,2024-11-10 11:52:02,"got pulled over by a cop for my number plate - here is how it went. so yesterday, i was riding my bike from sarjapur to koramangala, dealing with the usual dust, potholes, and bumper-to-bumper traffic, when suddenly a cop pulled me over right at a turn. i was already pretty annoyed with the heat and road conditions, but i pulled over as he asked.

he takes one look at my bike and says, ""why is your number plate in this font?"" i asked what the issue was, and he told me it was an old sticker type, and i should get it replaced. i said fine, i'd get it done.

then he hits me with, ""you need to pay a fine for it."" i asked him to explain the rule because i genuinely didn't know this was a problem. but he gets frustrated and says, ""everyone’s asking me the same thing; i can’t explain this whole rule to each person.”

i told him, ""okay, if it’s an issue, just put the fine on the vehicle—i’ll sort it out in court if needed."" he paused for a second, then said, ""if we go that route, we’d have to take your vehicle to court."" i was like, ""alright, let’s do it.""

after about 30 seconds, he backed off and told me to get it changed within 10 days, or i might face a 500₹ fine, which doubles on a repeat offense.

sometimes, standing your ground actually works! so, the next time when someone stops in the motive of just luring the money please talk for yourselves and tell them to put fine on the vehicle and you'll pay in the court. they would most probably just leave you.

also, there's a new rule regarding the hsrp number plate thing in karnataka. please google it and do the necessary to save yourself from these kind of cops."

reddit,2024-11-10 20:22:55,"zepto but for garbage collection hey everyone,

i'm exploring a startup idea specifically targeting the garbage collection mess in indian cities (initially bangalore). here's the concept:

problem:
- unreliable government garbage collection
- apartment complexes struggling with waste management
- no professional/tech-enabled solution
- growing urban waste crisis

solution: an app-based garbage collection service

key features:
- schedule pickups through app
- real-time tracking
- professional waste collectors
- proper segregation and disposal
- monthly subscription model
- both residential &amp; commercial services

target market:
- apartment complexes
- gated communities
- commercial spaces
- individual homes in areas with poor collection

revenue model:
- monthly subscriptions (₹299-499)
- premium services
- commercial contracts
- recycling partnerships

questions for r/bangalore:
1. would people pay for reliable garbage collection?
2. any major operational challenges i'm missing?
3. how to handle local body permissions/regulations?
4. anyone here from bangalore who can share insights about waste management pain points?
5. thoughts on scalability to other cities?

looking for honest feedback, especially from people who've run operations-heavy startups or those familiar with waste management space."

got a call from bbmp guy , asking name and where i live ,why did you complain about garbage being burnt in the group.

i told simply i put a pic about garbage being burnt openly , when lot of smoke is coming

he started hurling abuses , kept the phone in airplane mode , to avoid the conversation

bbmp guys are worse , with no proper plan to save bengaluru , they either dump in landfill / burn the garbage in large amounts , so surrounding air get's polluted."

reddit,2024-11-12 09:02:14,"indian road quality  for all the chest thumping our gov likes to do about how many km of new road infrastructure is being built everyday, there's another side to it - the terrible quality of the roads.

for the civil engineers/urban planners out there - can you comment on why indian road quality is so terrible?

does it just have to do with corruption in awarding tenders/contracts and the contractors doing subpar work so as to keep getting more work to repair said subpar work? or is the general quality of our roadwork just inferior? are we unable to make good roads that last? or is there another reason?

i'm from mumbai, so for example on the so called great development that is the coastal highway project - after just a few months of use - there is already patchwork visible on the highway which is due to some repairs/retarring for whatever reason. and this is meant to be a highway quality road, i'm not even talking about normal roads which in almost all cases are filled with potholes, bumps, manhole covers, etc etc which basically ensures you cannot have a smooth ride. the mumbai - vapi (south gujarat) stretch of the national highway is another example of just an absolute mess. i'm sure there are tons of other examples all over india."

reddit,2024-11-14 09:08:52,"new flair and a mod announcement on opinion posts about namma bengaluru 

ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ
ellarigu namaskara.

i'm sure that the community will agree when i say that namma bengaluru is in the cynosure of news and not always for the better reasons. 

i'm sure that we agree that all the cities have their own set of problems and share common infrastructure problems. so does namma bengaluru.

r/bangalore will always be a place to voice out your concerns and deal with them in a constructive criticism.

there have been plenty of posts that have done that.

but for every one post that goes in a right way without any flame wars, there have been several posts that devolve into another anti- hindi, anti-kannadiga, anti-migrant and anti-local fights. 

we also noticed a concentrated uptick of posts which fanned the flames in a negative manner. as custodians of this community, we have removed a large number of posts for every few that slip through. 

for every post about that speaks about auto drivers harassment, road rage, sexual harassment and other issues that migrants/locals face which we have allowed, we have never demanded any proof and took them on their face value.

this has been misused by certain elements. 

going forward, any post that has a story about your negative experiences, harassment, abuse or any of the other ‘clickbaity’ stuff needs to be tagged under the new flair called ""citizen's report"".

this should be supported with evidence/proof in a digital form which can be shared inside the post or can be sent over a modmail (if you don't want to share publicly).

we will tag such posts as unverified or verified basis the verification, either through a flair or a comment. for publicly available proof submitted inside the post, we will allow the community to decide whether it's fake or not.

any such negative posts submitted without any proof will be removed. 

examples of what will we not remove without proof

* live updates about any traffic situations
* live updates on disastrous weather conditions

examples of what will we remove without proof

* auto driver conned me, abused me, hit me, took me on a wrong route. we all know how our auto gurus are and thank you.

users found misusing or posting malicious/ manipulated/ old content and intentionally misleading the community will be banned and their content purged.

reddit,2024-11-15 17:46:11,"indians have a commodity mindset often hear the ""indians can't have good things"". our mindset is certainly one that does not inspire confidence. 

low quality and short changing is the norm. what you see/hear is never what you get. be it a product, service or even something as obscure and seemingly minor as a promise of a clean glass of water at a rest stop.

we can't build things that last. be it a road, building or even a company - eventually, it's overrun with typical indian shortcut jugaad mindset and petty politics. things then go to crap. 

when we do build good things, we don't care about them. we can't maintain anything. we can't keep our cities clean. we will clean our own homes religiously but not think twice about tossing garbage onto the street, and then complain that the government/public service does nothing.

collectively, we just accept mediocrity. we don't hold ourselves accountable. we love blaming everybody but ourselves. we are accustomed to living with a shitty quality of life and do nothing as a society to try and improve things as individuals."

yesterday i had been to a books santhe organized by veera loka publications in shalini grounds, jayanagar. 

there were 50+ stalls where different publishers sold thier books 10-20% discount. 

the intent of this book mela was to bring the much needed attention to kannada books, authors and to promote kannada reading and to celebrate kannada literature.

today they have several programs including some book launches and many kannada authors are expected to attend the mela. tn seetharam is scheduled to attend the mela today. 

today is the last of a 3day program. 

as for my experience, i was really happy seeing so hundreds of kannada readers gathering, when i thought kannada readers are decreasing by the day. 

i bought and intersting book called 'kunigal to kandahar', i also met the author manjunath kunigal. the book details a personal account of him working as an electrical engineer with nato, in occupied afghanistan. 
i also bought another book called 'roudravarnam' by anantha kunigal. 

please visit shalini grounds, jayanagar. please support kannada authors and encourage kannada reading. 

for more details about the santhe contact - 70221 22121/ 88612 12172

reddit,2024-11-18 18:54:01,"quality of engineering colleges in bengaluru and churning graduates  well bengaluru and southern counter parts are producing more engineers than the actual demand , and we're seeing the effects post pandemic , while some skilled students figure out what they want to do earlier and join internships in second/ third year itself (private deemed univ.) , state run university students are still stuck even when the final year is approaching

most of the core branch tier 3 students like electrical/mechanical/civil have been letting go of their own branch , and join jspider's / qspiders for some full stack or testing courses ,the demand has severely gone down. most of the electrical branch in my college 70-80% students were jobless graduated fall 2022 ,  it was non-autonomous.

electrical students aren't even aware of vlsi as a career path . vtu also is very poor and outdated in it's curriculum and doesn't even match the current standards , in this fast paced ai automation world were cost cutting is the trend and saving jobs have been literally a challenging task 70hrs work etc , and when they think about it they are already graduated

i would want to know what's the situation in autonomous colleges , are they giving you a good level playing field , so you're industry ready?

edit : so what's the future, some are doing food business and there are rare people who start a tech company , that can scale up"

reddit,2024-11-19 14:30:58,"why govt is not incentivised to solve pollution problem ? considering how delhi / punjab / up / haryana or the centre has let this issue persist for more a decade. was thinking about the reasons for insufficient action of govt. and its pretty clear why this issue is here to stay.

the advantage of air pollution to govts:

1) delhi govt has doubled parking charges for all major places like c.p / khan market - so double the earning for no extra work.

2) a lot of challans are being issued due to non valid puc (which i don't know how useful it is) or using bs-iii engine - again a big excuse to extract lots of money for no real work.

3) petrol cars now have 15 years &amp; diesel cars have 10 year life, after that they are not allowed in delhi. so just like that, it has accelerated the buy-sell cycle of car. in all of this, the govt enjoys heavy gst + cess &amp; road tax and what not.

4) folks have to buy air purifiers, give 18% gst

5) get health issues - buy medicines, get hospitalisation - more tax to govt.

6) scared so you buy health insurance ? - 18% tax to govt.

7) easy blame game - state govt blames center, center blames state govt. so if the blame is not on you, why you take action ?

8) people forget issue in feb. so why bother as come april - may, they will complain about rising heat &amp; then about water logging in monsoon.

------------------------------------------

consider the opposite, if govt takes some strict action:

1) farmers will be angry, you lose election

2) tell companies to fix their waste - industrialists get angry and you get less donation

3) all the free tax collection due to newer cars, challans, air purifiers, medical bills etc will be lost

4) extra money would have to be spend in cleaning all the dust on street

5) since its easy to divert blame, its also difficult to get full credit - for any good work, both state &amp; center govts will claim credit, so it won't lead to major votes gain.

------------------------------------------

the rich and politically connected have their purifiers and can go abroad if needed.

the poor will anyway have a difficult life, and can be easily won over by schemes like ladli bahen.

the middle class is stuck - they have jobs, their kids go to school in the city, they have small shops in the city. its not easy to sell everything, disrupt your entire family and just go somewhere else.

------------------------------------------

based on all of this, i feel thats it's obvious that govts have no reason at all to fix the situation. its here to stay &amp; we are doomed.

edit - not just govt, we are part of the problem too. we can vent just on reddit &amp; twitter. but won't take to the street - we are too afraid that we can lose our job, face govt backlash, thrown into prison, so taking the coward way out by being a keyboard warrior."
reddit,2024-11-19 19:14:00,"living in delhi: a struggle against declining quality of life i have lived in rohini, delhi, all my life, but over the past six years, it feels like rohini has been in a freefall, embodying everything negative one could imagine. there is a saying: *'no matter what, the next generation will always lead a better life than the previous one.'* unfortunately, this does not seem true for me and many others who are living in delhi.

where i live, the problems are overwhelming. air pollution is pervasive across the entire city, but the aqi in rohini is in a league of its own. yesterday, it reached a staggering 1840 in the afternoon. noise pollution is severe, and even the water is no longer drinkable. i am at a complete loss as to how these issues persist despite rising disposable incomes and increased taxes. people in tier 4 or tier 5 cities seem to have better basic amenities and quality of life compared to us in terms of health and well-being.

inflation is eroding the wealth of the middle class, and everything except salaries is rising exponentially. buying a house in a peaceful and good locality - even after selling our dda flat - feels like an unattainable dream. on top of this, any extra income from stock markets or other investments is heavily taxed. moving to a developed western country is becoming more challenging with each passing day, partly because many indians already settled abroad bring their problems along and resist adapting to the culture.

i have never felt more anxious in my life, and my motivation is dwindling every single day. it feels like i am so fed up with everything that i am resigned to staying in this hell, rather than trying to change anything.

is there anyone else in delhi who feels the same way? if so, how are you managing to stay afloat during these tough times?"

how can i start a cafe (bakery + eatery + tap station [after 6 months]) without any income source. i have a degree of computer science engineering. and want to start a business in my city (tier 2). 

the business i want to start i already have two competition in my city.

background: i’m 23 years old, middle class. i don’t have capital to invest at all and after discussing with my parents they don’t have either (seriously they don’t).

my thoughts : i want to start this business on the basis of bank loans, at the moment of writing this i don’t have idea if bank provides loans for this kinds of projects or not. plus i think after taking rough estimates it will overall cost me around 30l, and the big problem is if i decide to use my home for that it is too small for this business and in crowded area and i don’t have owned place on road side nor a nearby farm. i live in middle of city so can’t go outside just to start a business, plus i will have to find a place where people are willing to come. 

big question: what i should do as of now to build this business? all i can think of is bank but is it possible to get 30 to 40l from them ? 

my thoughts on big question: there’s one way i thought but it will take lot of time, i’m planning to do ms in finance in usa (spring 2025) it will take like 2 years then i will get job there. then if i saved every month like 300k then only i can put my funds but that won’t be enough. and second way is if i grow my network and connections in vc’s then i can think of that business but then i will have to think of bigger one instead of this small one. 

what the fuck i should do i’m going crazy.
thank you for reading and responding i appreciate you guys support."

reddit,2024-11-20 08:38:17,"demand for sidewalks  we lack overall safety in this country. not just for women but the general public is unsafe on these roads. 

driving is horrible, rules are not followed in small roads. 


but i think what’s worse is lack of footpaths, sidewalks, and road crossings for general public. i’ve returned to bangalore after 5 years and feel like overall it’s become worse. except traffic, it seemed to have improved. 

why don’t we pressure our government to build us some proper sidewalks and roads crossings? it’s so unsafe. i’ve seen most people just walk on roads since there’s no sidewalk. 

i know there are larger problems to address but this is much easier to fix and will build a sense of safety for everyone walking around instead of walking on roads. 

what do you all think? seems like a functioning anarchy sometimes but does it have to be this way? 

edit: well i guess people have given up on this issue…but it’s the will of the people that brings any noticeable change."

reddit,2024-11-22 13:48:33,"bangalore is a completely different city than we think it is. moved to padmanabhanagar from varthur recently and now i am in complete cultural and societal shock.  i just joined reddit few days ago and this is my very first post - i am originally from haryana. i spent my childhood in gurgaon, pursued my education in mumbai, and completed my master’s and worked in the us. i moved to bangalore four years ago and initially lived in varthur. during that time, i fell in love with a localite who was my colleague. we got married, and six months ago, i moved to his house in padmanabhanagar.

during my stay in varthur, i often felt that bangalore was overrated. although it is marketed as a tech hub, my experience was limited to its proximity to the tech park. the area lacked proper roads, infrastructure, amenities, and—most importantly for me—culture. it felt non-existent. people were rude, disconnected from each other, and the place resembled a lifeless concrete jungle—more like a concrete immigrant asylum.

fast forward to today, i now live in padmanabhanagar, which is probably deep in the heart of bengaluru towards south west. it’s a place where someone like me, a ""north"" techie would least expect to venture, because there is no point living there unless you are a localite, tech parks are far away from that place, but i shifted to complete wfh now.

i was shocked and baffled by this place. the infrastructure is top-notch—though not quite like the us, it is far above the standards of a typical indian city. there are beautiful parks, trees that almost touch the streets, and no water issues, all the footpaths and roads are very well maintained, though there are few potholes here and there (this is probably the de-facto standard of india). it is on par with the posh areas of mumbai that i used to visit during my college days.

more importantly, i want to talk about the people. they are completely different from those in varthur. i initially thought my inability to speak kannada would be a problem here, but guess what—almost everyone knows english, and i didn’t face any issues at all. the south indian culture we often see on tv or read about in books is very much alive here. my husband was born and bought up here, so he knows the entire block we live in and he has introduced me already to everyone lol.  the people here seem educated and come from well-to-do families, they are culturally rooted - yet they seem progressive. many of their children are pursuing master’s degrees in the us or working in some tech companies or non-tech in bangalore. i was pleasantly surprised by how accepting they are. for example, i would wear short clothes while going for a walk, and unlike in varthur, nobody stared at me angrily.

the temples here are also incredibly beautiful. there are several popular places nearby, like the banashankari 2nd stage market complex, gandhi bazaar, and basavanagudi.

i’m amazed at how different the cultures and vibes can be within the same city. when i lived in varthur, i never imagined bangalore could be so beautiful and welcoming. now that i’m here, i feel incredibly lucky, and i don’t ever want to leave this place. i want to explore the city more and more."
reddit,2024-11-22 22:26:12,"how is garbage collected in your apartment (gated community)? hi all, i am looking for information on how garbage is collected in apartments (gated communities) across bengaluru. 
i would appreciate it if you could specify how garbage collection is done at your apartment.
does housekeeping come to your floor and door to collect it?
what is the frequency of collection (daily, weekly etc.)
or do you have to go to the garbage collection point to throw it? (how often do you do that?)
do you have option to throw wet and dry wastes separately?
how do you handle your e-waste, recyclable waste (papers, plastics, etc.)
do you get any benefits or cash for such waste?
in case you know, please tell how much maintenance your apartment charges for housekeeping?"

reddit,2024-11-23 18:16:34,"bad experiences in my neighborhood from a native bangalorean edit title correction:  bad experience in my neighborhood from a bad neighbor   
  
being a native bangalorean , where i live the neighbors won't at all to care if there's any problem or fight goes on, they happily stay in their own houses.

my father had helped them by providing construction assistance in our site surroundings, for their works like cement plastering etc. the workers used to dump construction waste too in my site like cement debris, tea cups . to my dismay they didn't even provide invite for their housewarming ceremony. but there's no support at all when any trouble comes to me. all keep quiet, there's a man who was cutting the cauvery water connection pipeline at 12am for repairs, because some other man had damaged it. forcing us for a repair. my father is real culprit he doesn't want to ever go to police

i was attacked in my face near the eyes , luckily didn't turn serious ,for some broken window glass which monkey had damaged it, just because his house faced our side and stupid tenant complained a day after the incident, we were held responsible , when complained to police they too didn't investigate the cause , and policeman told that if we go to court for hearing it will go longer, suggested to compromise , it happened last year november.

my heart feels sad as we have no other houses / paying rent is also very high if we ever tried to shift. did you ever get beaten up by a neighbor? i want to know yours

ps: i know kannada"

reddit,2024-11-29 12:09:12,"my observations as an abcd visiting india after a gap of 10 years my background:  
visiting after a decade.

**the positives:**

1. crime in india is extremely overrated in most metros when compared to population. people returned my iphone 16 pro max 1 tb on a crowded city bus. crime is practically nonexistent for the affluent. if you're reading this and are scared to go to india... you have nothing to be scared of in any major city even as a single woman. just use common sense. the tenderloin in sf is much more dangerous.
2. the kindness of the average indian is supreme. not a single negative incident, everyone has been exceptionally kind.
3. even street sellers will return exact change and will refuse any pity on them. everyone wants to earn their money.
4. there's a vibrant local nightlife scene that's very distinct from the global one. this was the best part. every other nightlife scene in the world is the more or less the same but india is the only place where your local club will have penn masala level talent playing bollywood/tollywood/kollywood bangers at corner bar with lights/fog machines etc.
5. there's a vibrant comedy/poetry scene on top with extremely charismatic talent.
6. level of service is unmatched anywhere. food won't get just come to you but they'll put it on your plate and even feed it to you... if you want.
7. food per price point is unmatched, and much more flavorful.
8. no one really gives a fuck about religion. muslims don't even care about modi or think about him. sure they're opposed to his policies but most couldn't even tell you what policies those are. everyone just votes as per their community but religion isn't a point of friction  as its shown in the news. i went to a dargah, a temple, a church... everyone just does their thing, takes it seriously but no religious tensions ever flare up. the liberal media is lying to you. india is peaceful as fuck. no hindu nationalism... no fasicm. no one really gives a fuck and everyone is hustling to get by.
9. people just don't become aggressive here compared to white people or black people. everyone gets along somehow and even when they seem to fight... people just want to move on with their day quickly after hurling a few insults.
10. people look out for each other. even beggars know they'll survive because people are kind here. america is a country of outliers... it hates dumb/lazy/poor/unambitious people and punishes them for it... the system is designed to do that. here it's the opposite... people are ok with getting by.
11. managing this country... for anyone is an insane nightmare. it's a complex problem on a scale that's simply unprecedented in human history. indians should be extremely proud of how far they've come. somehow india just chugs along and works... flaws and all.

**the negatives:**

1. indians have gotten soft. a little bit of affluence made them too soft. kids don't slog for iit's anymore, they prefer ""well-roundedness"" or whatever first-world thing they try to emulate. the only indians who really grind are the really poor ones who travel as laborers hawking goods.
2. it's all style over substance. indians gate themselves into communities and build basketball courts etc. but as a whole don't implement zoning regulations etc.
3. it's actually fallen behind in tech a bit. i've met cs grads specializing in ml from iit delhi who didn't know what a transformer was... imagine that
4. just as a snake doesn't know it's a snake. indians know nothing about india. they limit themselves to local politics and gossip but have no idea about any other location or the vast diversity of this nation.
5. given that most advancements and developments happen in english, most middle-class indians wouldn't be able to articulate or formulate complex thoughts and calculate 2nd order consequences. not all languages are the same in this regard and not knowing english fluently is a huge handicap. basically i'm saying that most indians are not particularly bright.
6. things like nmacc etc are built as symbols for the aspirational indian middle class to feel a sense of global cosmopolitanism but fall far short of the oculus in nyc or o2 in london.  india truly has nothing for it's ultra rich. it's all hype with little to show for it. nita ambani or some pet project of some film star to build malls isn't going to cut it. it'll require serious private equity backing on a corporate level to build an experience in india to rival global standards. indians as such don't have anything worth seeing in its cities.
7. india over indexes on engineering talent and severely under invests in design talent. everything is designed so poorly... showers have no glass doors or tubs so the water falls right on the toiler bowl. they also don't use toilet paper and use bidets so it makes it very weird and tracks dirt and grime. doors use bolts which can be locked from the outside... so anyone can lock you in your own home from the outside by bolting it. many other examples of retarded design.
8. indian houses are nightmares with live electricity cables, shitty designs etc
9. traffic laws are non-existent and honking is ever-present.
10. ambition in indians is dying. even auto drivers i spoke to told me how happy they were with what they were doing and had no fiscal planning.
11. there are too many people and not enough jobs. so you have stupid jobs like lift operator... a guy who sits in the elevator and his job is to ask you your floor and press the button... so many other stupid jobs like this. automation will kill the indian workforce.
12. there extremely dehumanizing jobs involving sewage etc that are still done by untouchables and lower castes. pray to god everyday you're born into the family you were born into.
13. urban cities in india are very ugly.. there is nothing beautiful as such here. the cityscape and such is very ugly. there are junkyards in california with less filth than juhu beach... maybe the deserts of rajasthan and himalayas are beautiful but indian cities are extremely ugly.
14. there's dust, pollution... industrial waste and contamination and mosquitoes everywhere...
15. areas like malabar hill, jubilee hills, poes garden aren't even better than your average suburban neighhborhood in palo alto. i'm sure the inside is better and opulent but again... there are diminishing returns to that. what's the point of building antilia if all you can see are slums? to assert power in the city?
16. a lot of these negatives are worse in areas like san francisco but india doesn't balance it out with high pay or high innovation like sf.

final verdict: if you can emigrate out try to. you can get the best of both world in thriving diaspora communities."

before some of you ask me to go back to where i came from, i am a kannadiga and i've spent my entire life here. i love this city, but the power cuts are just too frustrating."

reddit,2024-12-01 12:57:49,"i raised a complaint with bbmp and it actually worked (within a day).  https://imgur.com/a/f6qudde

i live in malleshwaram. recently, we started experiencing a foul smell coming from the drainage. initially, we thought it might be due to a dead animal, but the smell kept getting worse day by day. so, i decided to raise a complaint yesterday evening.

here’s what i did:

1. i visited the bbmp website: https://site.bbmp.gov.in/mp3.html.


2. i clicked on the ""grievance"" button.


3. i sent ""hi"" to the whatsapp number listed there.


4. about an hour later, i received a call from someone who asked about the issue.


5. i explained the problem to him, and he provided me with my ward's helpline number.


6. i called the helpline and explained the issue.


early this morning, i saw the drainage management squad on my street. they opened the drainage and identified the problem: a blockage causing internal water stagnation. the entire repair operation took about an hour, and now the issue is resolved, and the smell is gone.

i wanted to share this process so that others facing similar problems in their areas can follow it. additionally, i found out later that there is an app, which is even easier to use."

reddit,2024-12-03 08:30:22,"bbmp strike and hooliganism congrats to the set of hooligans who decided to dump garbage in front of my house in the name of ""strike"". my road literally stinks now.

long story short, the garbage collector comes as per usual and is picking up garbage from everyone. around 20 people appear suddenly in 2 wheelers and start making a lot of noise.

apparently there's a strike going on and the man was ignoring the strike by doing his work. these hooligans then proceed to physicially assault said man, nearly upend his garbage van and successfully dump all the garbage in front of my house. they proceed to move his now empty van physically and get out of there.

shoutout to the person who was doing his job and did his utmost to make sure that the garbage wasn't dumped there (of course, he nearly got beaten up for this). hope he's safe from these hooligans.

tl;dr - garbage man gets nearly assaulted and is forced to dump all the garbage he had collected in front of house, thanks to the strike."

reddit,2024-12-04 21:25:31,"the roads of bangalore are a complete nightmare – when will this end? bangalore’s roads have become nothing short of a deathtrap. specifically, the stretch from silk board towards eco space is absolutely horrendous! the service roads are filled with potholes so big, they could fit a 1bhk flat! and i’m not exaggerating. stones and debris are scattered everywhere, making it downright life-threatening to even drive or ride through these roads. one wrong move, and it could be fatal.

and the worst part? this is happening in a city where we pay some of the highest rto charges in the country! where does all that money even go? certainly not into fixing our roads. it’s infuriating to see that despite paying through the nose for vehicle registration, basic infrastructure is non-existent.

traffic here is already unbearable. it takes hours just to cover 5-6 kilometers. and to top it all off, when they finally do attempt to “fix” the roads, they just dump loose gravel into the potholes. there’s no actual repair work, no real effort to solve the problem. it’s clear the authorities know about this mess, but they just don’t care.

this is all a direct result of corruption in the bbmp and the utter negligence of our government. it’s mind-boggling how things can be this bad, and no one is held accountable.

at this point, it’s more than just frustrating – it’s saddening. every day, people struggle on these roads, just trying to go about their daily lives. watching this unfold is not only infuriating, but it also makes you wonder if anything will ever change in this city. is it too much to ask for basic infrastructure after paying so much in taxes and fees?

we deserve better.

ps: sorry but not sorry but the long rant after a wednesday office commute. 
your regular it guy."

reddit,2024-12-06 21:10:49,"gruha jyoti yojana doubts hi everyone

as the title states, i wanted to ask about the gruha jyoti yojana. i am currently a tenant living on rent in a subleased property (kots, jic some might know about it). with this company, the setup is such that they calculate the electricity bill on their own based on bescom's calculation method and collect it with the rent. according to my understanding of the three circulars about this scheme on bescom's website, there are no rules that state that i cannot apply for this scheme. but according to the kots staff these are the conditions for applying to this scheme:

&gt;if one wants to avail karnataka gruha jyothi scheme for 200 units of free electricity, both the below conditions must be true.

&gt;1. registered voter id and adhaar card for current address before the scheme announcement.

&gt;2. one should have directly rented the apartment from a landlord who has a separate meter connection for you.

i have repeatedly asked for a reference to this but they have not shared it. it looks to me like they have an issue with me applying for this scheme and do not want it to happen at any cost.

on the other hand, these are some related statements i extracted from the circulars:

&gt;the first circular states, ""this scheme is applicable only for household electricity connections; not applicable if electricity is used for commercial purposes.""

&gt;it also states, ""under the griha jyoti scheme, a maximum consumption limit of 200 units per household per month in the state based on the monthly average consumption (based on the consumption of the financial year 2022-23) units of each consumer. allow 10 percent higher power consumption limit, accordingly, the cabinet has approved to provide the amount of electricity bill free of cost and to pay the full electricity bill for consumers who consume more than 200 units.""

&gt;the second circular says: ""this scheme applies to all those houses which have a separate meter and meter reading is done.""

i had already applied for the scheme and my application has also gone through (still waiting to see if the electricity bill comes or not. it should not since my consumption is below 200 units and its a new flat with no past data either). i also have a separate meter. also, i can see an option to pay for this meter through upi apps that automate this payment.

1. does anybody know if what they are saying is correct or not? am i eligible for the scheme or not?
2. does anybody know whether my application going through means i am eligible for this scheme?
3. finally, kots mentioned, ""even if your application goes through we are required to inform the bescom dept. and get it reversed."". can they do that? if their reasoning is valid, then i have no concern, in fact, i'll get it reversed myself but if not, can taking this action be considered as infringing on my rights as a tenant?"

reddit,2024-12-07 11:46:49,"are berlin and new delhi in a tussle over bangladesh? india has issued a usd 1.4 billion tax evasion notice to volkswagen, accusing the automaker of misclassifying imported car components as individual parts to pay lower duties, according to a september 30 document seen by reuters.\[1\] in this article published on 29 november 2024, reuters reports that indian investigators allege volkswagen’s local unit, skoda auto volkswagen india, evaded taxes on models like the audi a4, skoda kodiaq, and vw tiguan by splitting shipments and declaring them as parts instead of completely knocked down units (ckds), which attract higher import duties. the notice claims this “artificial arrangement” led to a usd 1.36 billion shortfall since 2012, with potential penalties doubling the liability to usd 2.8 billion. volkswagen, under scrutiny following searches of its facilities and executive questioning, denies wrongdoing and is reviewing the claims while cooperating with authorities. the controversy adds to the carmaker’s challenges, including global market pressures and struggles to expand its small share in india’s competitive automotive sector.

my thoughts/non-thoughts: the issuance of a usd 1.4 billion tax evasion notice to volkswagen’s indian subsidiary is a significant action, likely requiring authorisation from the highest levels of government. such a substantial claim suggests deliberate and coordinated decision-making within india’s politico-legal framework. this controversy also comes at a particularly fraught moment for volkswagen.\[2\] in germany, the company faces labor unrest with nearly 100,000 workers striking against proposed 10% pay cuts and potential plant closures. volkswagen justifies these measures as necessary to counter rising labor costs and fierce competition from chinese automakers. as negotiations continue, the group’s global challenges are piling up.

what makes the timing of india’s tax notice intriguing is its proximity to germany’s recent overtures to bangladesh - a nation navigating a delicate transition after the ouster of sheikh hasina. having been largely aligned with india in the recent past, bangladesh now accuses its neighbour of interference, from harbouring hasina in exile to fuelling narratives of minority mistreatment. this has led to heightened tensions, with india pressuring bangladesh on minority rights and dhaka pushing back against perceived meddling.

amid this discord, germany has stepped in with calculated diplomacy. on november 28, german ambassador achim tröster reaffirmed support for bangladesh’s interim government, focusing on reforms in climate action, green energy, vocational training, and labor conditions - key to bangladesh’s goals as it transitions from the least developed countries (ldc) list.\[3\] germany has also announced a financial commitment of eur 181 million to these efforts, targeting renewable energy, urban development, and social welfare, marking its largest financial package in recent years.\[4\]

further solidifying its influence, germany helped launch the european chamber of commerce (eurocham) in bangladesh earlier this month, strengthening trade ties and signalling deeper european engagement in the region.\[5\] this strategic move positions germany as a partner in building bangladesh’s future, particularly as the nation seeks alternatives to its reliance on india.

the timing of all this is strikingly curious. germany’s eur 181 million financial package to bangladesh is not mere aid - it is a calculated geopolitical statement. berlin’s intent to deepen ties with dhaka, offering economic lifelines and strategic alignment, comes as regional tensions with india reach a boiling point. at the same time, india’s usd 1.4 billion tax notice against volkswagen - a linchpin of german industry - feels far too pointed to dismiss as coincidence, carrying the air of a veiled warning. however, this tactic risks backfiring, as it could signal to the west that india’s legal and regulatory framework remains unpredictable and vulnerable to political maneuvering. such perceptions could erode investor confidence, potentially making india a less desirable destination for foreign investments at a time when it is vying to position itself as a global economic powerhouse.

what’s more ominous for new delhi is the growing roster of players visibly supporting dhaka. germany’s involvement adds to the united states’ increasing interest in bangladesh, both economically and strategically. this signals that dhaka may not face isolation even as india inches closer to enacting a de facto trade embargo or intensifies diplomatic alienation. the emergence of alternative allies for bangladesh undermines india’s leverage, forcing new delhi to contend with a shifting balance of influence in its own backyard.

coincidence? unlikely. in geopolitics, timing is everything. moves like these signal shifts in power, and for india, the costs of missteps could ripple far beyond its immediate borders.

reddit,2024-12-09 09:44:14,"ai driven signals making traffic worse have noticed in the last couple months that the ai driven signals have made traffic worse. there are longer waiting times and congestion. 

in basavanagudi firstly, there was no traffic problem before the new signal. now there is a pile up and minimum two signals of waiting.

at the same junction, there is a 20 second green  signal. by the time people put their phones away and start their vehicles the signal is red. 

another major congestion is the minerva circle signal. before the ai signals, the road was more or less free or there was lesser traffic. now there is a traffic jam till sajjan rao circle and minimum wait of 3 signals. 

this has been the route to work for 6 years now but only after the new signals it's become bad."

reddit,2024-12-10 22:19:46,"poor service and tons of fake reviews by realme service centre i live near hsr layout and about four weeks ago, i accidentally water-damaged my brand-new phone (realme gt 6t). i searched for nearby service centers, but the official ones were around 20 km away. furthermore, i know that water damage wouldn't be covered under my phone's warranty, and the repair costs would be quite high (more than half of the cost of my phone since i purchased it in a sale) and that wasn't worth it. in a hurry, i decided to go to the service center with the best reviews near me, which claimed to be an official partner and had over 250 reviews with an average rating of 4.9 stars.

they took my phone for diagnosis and told me it had several issues: the processor was failing and overheating, the volume button and proximity sensor were burned, and it would cost me ₹8500 for repair with new parts. since the phone was still fairly new (i had bought it for around ₹26,000), i confirmed from them the price wouldn’t go higher and gave them the go-ahead. afterward, they kept delaying the repair, claiming that parts weren’t available.

unfortunately, i had to provide my screen lock pattern to them for testing. after two weeks of constant follow-ups where they ignored my calls, they finally picked up and claimed they had repaired the phone. however, they said the screen was burned too and they replaced it for an additional ₹6,000. they even accused me of giving them a ""dead phone,"" which i denied aggressively and demanded my phone back. before i gave them my phone, it was turning on but back was heating fast and network wasn't available so i couldn't have turned it on, removed data or anything. 

they insisted i still owed them ₹8500, which i refused to pay until we resolved the issue face to face. i suspected they were going to install a cheap, duplicate screen, as no original screen of that phone would cost just 6k so i decided to visit their shop. when i arrived, they said it was actually their mistake—there was fungus in the connectors, not a damaged screen—and they replaced back the screen with the original one. they assured me the phone was now working fine.

i went to test the phone, but the network was still unavailable. i asked them to fix it properly and thoroughly test the phone. after another two weeks, during which they switched off their phone most of the time and ignored my calls, i finally got my phone back.

i ended up paying ₹9,000 for the repair, but the real problem started when i thoroughly checked my phone today. i discovered that they had posted a fake review using one of my google accounts, one i rarely use. now, i’m certain they accessed my phone and compromised my data. fortunately, most of my apps are protected by different patterns, and my upi is relatively secure, but my phone, data and accounts are now fully compromised. they posted a review for one of the phones they repaired with my phone's camera and account.

i need to reset my phone and recover my data urgently, but i wanted to share this experience with everyone. it seems they’ve been posting fake reviews using customers' phones after repairs, and most customers never realize it. i only found out because i received an email from google about a review on my account—one i never posted.  so, it's a request everyone, please don't rely on the reviews themselves. i had a similar experience with many other places here in bangalore as well, where they've way too good review but the reality is shit."

reddit,2024-12-11 18:21:01,"appreciation post - road on kadugodi flyover the kadugodi flyover was a notorious bottleneck since it's like a 1.5 lane road on each side. when i shifted to this area, there was traffic starting from belathur cross till the flyover i.e. almost 500m everyday only because the flyover was narrow and had dangerous potholes, size of a bike to be honest.

recently they removed/milled the existing road and relaid it completely.  the results? now the traffic has become half. like hardly 100-200 m before the flyover because now vehicles travel at 30-40 kph compared to earlier 10-20kph. better late than never right?

this just goes onto show how much a simple solution i.e. roads without potholes can do to traffic. again this doesn't solve all traffic problems but in multiple areas across the city."

reddit,2024-12-12 11:26:42,"the people giving government exams are exactly the ones who shouldn’t be working for the government the mindset of most people preparing for government exams boils down to one thing: *“ek bar sarkari naukri lag gayi, fir maze hi maze.”* they’re not thinking about serving the country; it’s all about personal gain. now, wanting stability or financial security isn’t inherently wrong, but the issue is with our system. it’s still stuck in a colonial hangover, designed more to control the public than to serve them. add to that the unchecked power from india’s socialist phase, and what we have now is one of the most corrupt, selfish, and incompetent systems imaginable.

take a look around—whether it’s teachers, clerks, dms, ias, ips officers, police, or engineers—99% barely do their jobs. they’re unmotivated, corrupt, and completely out of touch. it’s not about merit or real-world skills; it’s about cracking an outdated exam. why should someone responsible for thousands, if not millions, of lives, get hired based on rote learning and “reserving” a seat for themselves instead of proving actual competence?

government jobs need a complete overhaul:

1. **merit-based hiring:** postings should rely on proven skills and real-world experience. why not hire directly from private sectors where people have a track record of results?
2. **performance over permanence:** scrap the idea of permanent postings. make it all performance-based. if someone isn’t doing their job, fire them—no endless transfers to shift the problem elsewhere.
3. **strict punishments for corruption:** corruption shouldn’t just be a slap on the wrist. life imprisonment for serious offenses and, in extreme cases where lakhs of lives (human or animal) are affected, even the death penalty. extreme? maybe. but how else do you fix extreme rot?
4. **reservations and real change:** some will argue that merit-based hiring will hurt marginalized communities, but here’s the thing—they need good governance *the most.* instead of uplifting just 5 families by giving out reserved jobs, why not have 5 highly competent people (irrespective of caste) bring meaningful change to 5,000 families?
5. **accountability:** look at the fssai. it might as well not exist! their sole purpose seems to be taking bribes from restaurant owners. what’s the point of having food inspectors if they don’t ensure food safety? similarly, roads wash out every few months. where is the accountability for the engineers and babus who are supposed to check the quality of work? why do we accept this level of failure as normal?
6. **bureaucratic red tape:** government offices are a nightmare of inefficiency. from the smallest clerk to the highest officer, everyone seems to be working at a snail’s pace. public servants should be just that—*servants* of the public, not gatekeepers of progress.

teachers who are completely unmotivated should be fired immediately. what’s the point of education if marginalized kids are getting nothing out of it? even mid-day meals, which are supposed to nourish these kids, get eaten up by corrupt “babu log.”

at the end of the day, we can change the governments, but the same “sahebs” remain in power, controlling everything while the system crumbles. if we’re serious about uplifting our country, the entire system needs to change. think about it."

reddit,2024-12-12 15:11:39,"why is it so difficult to be honest in this country ?  long time pending rant but just wanted to share my experience with getting the gst certificate in india. we were rejected 6 times in the past 6 months with random reasons. 

we first applied in may 2024 with all the documents needed. everything was correct and since we applied at the end of the month, they rejected us saying the electricity bill is old. we thought this was genuine and applied again in mid june. this time we were told the office rent agreement with the owner is not notarized when in fact it was. we thought maybe it was a mistake and we had applied too soon. so, this time we waited for a month and applied in august first week. they rejected us again, citing some random issue. at this point, we were sure it wasn't just the documents that were getting us rejected. so we applied again, with everything verified by a ca to check what was happening. this was september. unsurprisingly, rejected again. each time it took more than a week to get rejected. 

so after getting rejected twice again, we went to the gst office to ask them what's wrong and their response was ""we have rejected no gst registrations in the past 5 months"". at this point, we needed the gstn, as we had to close a contract with a client. so, we asked them what can we do so that it isn't rejected this time. they told us we need to pay for ""extra services"" to get it approved and i kid you not, we applied, paid the ""extra amount"" and got our gst certificate the next day. we did not even submit any new documents. just like that! 

we tried our best to be honest and not pay any ""extra charges"" but how do we deal with this ? this is plain harrasment. and this isn't just one off case. we had a hard time getting our name approved by the mca portal too. even after all services are online, why do these corrupt government officials have the power to do this to us. how to still retain the nationalist spirit when registering for a number that will help the government (literally paying them taxes) takes a fair amount of bribe to execute ? i'm not sure why anyone would register a company or do business here with these experiences."

reddit,2024-12-13 07:04:19,"the struggles of moving offices in “digital india” 
i recently shifted my office to a new location, but the experience of dealing with our so-called “digital india” systems left me in an endless bureaucratic loop. here’s the situation:
	1.	new property, new issues:
the new property was recently purchased by the landlord, and i rented it right after. while shifting and completing legal formalities, i realized the landlord’s name on the electricity bill was still the previous owner’s. this became a massive obstacle.
	2.	bank’s requirements:
to update my address for my current account, the bank demanded a gst certificate with the updated address. fair enough.
	3.	gst portal nightmare:
i raised a request on the gst portal to update my address, attaching the new rent agreement and the electricity bill (which still had the previous landlord’s name). i even provided proof of sale showing the new landlord’s ownership. despite this, the gst officer rejected the request, claiming the rent agreement didn’t match the electricity bill.
	4.	electricity department’s digital maze:
i then approached the electricity department to get the landlord’s name updated on the bill. but guess what? they told me everything is digitized now—no physical help is available. i had to do it online.
	5.	endless rejections:
i submitted all necessary documents online, but the system kept rejecting my requests. it felt like whoever was reviewing the case wasn’t reading my submissions properly or didn’t understand the urgency. worse, there’s no way to communicate directly with the person rejecting it or even understand the exact grounds for rejection.
	6.	the big takeaway:
this is where “digital india” fails. while digitization has its benefits, the lack of physical support for unique or urgent cases is a huge problem. not everyone’s issue fits neatly into an automated system. sometimes, human intervention is necessary to sort out discrepancies.

has anyone else been through something similar? how do you deal with these endless loops in a system that feels like it’s designed to reject instead of resolve? i’d love to hear if anyone has tips or a workaround for this."

reddit,2024-12-13 15:22:18,"feel really powerless given the ongoing issues in the country we are nearing the end of 2024 but our cities are filled with problems which should have been solved years ago.

our rules are outdated  
\- poor fsi regulations which no one seems to care about  
\- reservation which was supposed to be removed has actually increased (not saying it's bad but it should be updated keeping in mind the new dynamics of the country)  
\- alimony rules and regulations are now being used to harass men (in few cases but still an important issue)

our government is filled with corruption  
\- take any department in general and you can find cases of bribery, preferring their own etc  
\- 2% population is burdened with the highest tax  
\- this set of people are paying taxes more than once on the same income  
\- roads/infrastructure is sooo poor  
\- delhi is burning  
\- unemployment is rampant in the youth  
\- basic things in life like house, transport, education are becoming unaffordable by the day

what can we as citizens do about solving/tacking these issue? 

i have tried thinking about how can we use tech to solve these issues? maybe a platform where you can anonymously complain about certain people who are asking for bribe with details? but how do you solve for fake complaints? and who is responsible to look into this? 

i don't think sitting and cribbing is the only thing we can do. we need to do better."

reddit,2024-12-15 05:22:34,"indians lack both civic sense and rules. the thing is yes indians have the no civic sense in general but i think one of its factors is education and the surrounding also.

yar dekho mein india ko defend nhi kr rha i totally agree indians have very very less or no civic sense but it can be attributed to these factors.

no civic sense education(i read in an article that foreign schools of developed country tend to educate their population with regard to civic sense)

the surrounding

believe me or not when the surrounding aren't clean in itself who would want to himself just go throw their garbage in the dustbin.

bhai roads achi nhi hr jgeh road mein gdeh hein khi bhi kuda hein

tum sare hi batao is environment mein kisi ko bhi iski parwa hogi.

see indore for example cleanest city of india indians are in indore so why are they so clean.
its because the surrounding are clean.

sch yeh bhi hein ki jb ass pass ka area clean ho ton kuda phekne mein sharam bhi aati hein.

rules

this all can be solved by implementing rules or whatever.i remember in my area people very very rarely used to wear helmets but last year a senior police officer i don't know the tank transferred gear and overseed the implementation of the rules for month to come.
to this day he has transferred but i see most of the people driving with a helmet."

reddit,2024-12-17 23:04:15,"india is actually a good country to live if you can live in a village  m 22. 
i make about ₹70k per month and work from home, so i’ve chosen to live in my village, thirthahalli, in karnataka. life here is peaceful, with no noise or air pollution. while there are plenty of complaints about india these days in reddit but i choose to see the good part of where i live . for the taxes i pay, i feel i get decent facilities, like good roads even in rural areas. sure, the heavy rainfall damages them as this is a heavy rainfall region, but potholes are usually fixed within a month. the air is fresh, and quality food is just a 2 km bike ride away in the nearby taluk town. a ₹100 biryani here rivals the taste of top bangalore restaurants. electricity is almost free, and people are friendly and helpful.

when i get bored, i grab my fishing rod and head to the river. living here lets me enjoy a balanced, peaceful life while earning well. clean air, good infrastructure, affordable food, and a supportive community make me feel like i’ve made the right choice. for me, this simplicity and connection to nature outweigh the chaos of city living. 

i lived in bangalore for four years during my studies and hated the constant traffic. now, living in my village, i enjoy the freedom of less crowded roads and the calmness of rural life. being surrounded by dogs, birds, cows, and sometimes even snakes (haha) makes me feel much closer to nature. i stick to a 40-hour workweek, which gives me enough time to upskill, pursue hobbies, and truly enjoy my free time.

during engineering, i had different ambition . dreaming of living a cozy life in a fancy bangalore apartment and working endlessly to make a ton of money. but my perspective on life has completely changed now. it’s not that i’ve given up on ambitions like switching companies or improving my skills to earn more, but i no longer chase these goals at the expense of my peace of mind. life here feels more balanced, and that’s what matters to me the most. 

adding some photos of my life in village:

reddit,2024-12-20 20:03:50,"is india a lost cause? now a days coming across many posts showing india in bad light and as much as i dislike those deep down i know that it is the reality also every where i look , i see things which makes it worse.
- when i step out , all i see is trash piled up and people having zero civic sense
- when i drive, all i see is congestion, pollution and potholes
- when i open news, all i see our politicians doing hindu muslim and no one talking about real issues
- when i see my salary slip, all i see is our beloved fm is taking majority of it in taxes and providing nothing in return
- when i want to travel, all i see is see od people and exorbitant hote and flight l prices
- when i want to apply for a job, all i see is 1000 of people have already applied for it

i can go on and on

trust me i love this country and want to see it as the best in the world, but seeing all this day after day breaks my heart.

as my fellow indians what are your thoughts on this. do  we have any posiive ray of light or any suggestions how the situation can improve or what i fear is correct that india is a lost cause(sadly)"

reddit,2024-12-22 11:53:16,"what my marriage taught me about finding the right partner let me share a personal story that might resonate with those of you searching for a life partner. it’s not easy to admit, but my first marriage was a complete disaster. it ended painfully in divorce, and i want to tell you what i learned from it.

my ex-partner struggled with bipolar disorder—a condition that was never disclosed or treated. in our society, mental health issues carry a heavy stigma and are often swept under the rug. there’s an unspoken expectation that marriage itself will fix everything. i, too, believed that.

when i look back, i realize how naive i was. like many young people, i was full of confidence and optimism, assuming love alone could conquer all. i ignored glaring red flags—unpredictable bursts of anger, irrational behavior—thinking i could handle them.

after my divorce, i rebuilt my life in middle age and promised myself i’d do something to help others avoid the mistakes i made. that’s when i started exploring the power of psychometric assessments—tools widely used in corporate settings to evaluate personalities and behaviors.

i worked on adapting these tools for relationships. imagine a system that could:

* evaluate someone’s approach to conflict, communication, and emotional resilience.
* help you identify potential red flags before committing.
* recommend the kind of partner who would align with your personality and values.

it’s not about finding perfection—it’s about making informed decisions. these assessments can even guide you in creating an attractive profile that showcases your true self, cutting down wasted time and energy during your partner search.

marriage isn’t magic—it’s hard work, understanding, and self-awareness. if you’re serious about finding the right partner, consider looking into solutions that help you know yourself better and approach relationships with clarity.

what’s your take? would you trust an approach like this in your journey to finding “the one”?

  
**update: addressing some feedback**

i completely understand that many redditors are wary of posts that seem like advertisements or promotions. however, i want to assure you that my story is 100% true and deeply personal.

my venture wasn’t born out of a business idea—it came from the darkest moments of my life and a heartfelt desire to ensure others don’t have to endure the same pain. that’s why i chose to share it here.

i genuinely believe that this initiative can positively impact lives and, in the bigger picture, contribute to meaningful societal change. thank you for reading, and i truly hope my intentions come through."

reddit,2024-12-22 16:34:35,"why do we expect others to change when we don't make an attempt to change ourselves? i see so many posts only discussing about the problems in this country. rarely a post which discusses any solution for them. i will try to make an attempt to discuss, what ""we"" can do and what's actually in ""our"" hand.   


today, i saw a guy toss an empty chips packet on the road, right next to a trash bin. i politely pointed out that the bin was just a few steps away. his response? ""what difference does it make? everyone does it, and nothing will change if i stop littering.""(in local language)

i'm sure you would get a similar response if you attempt to question or ask them. because it reflects a deep-rooted problem: we’re quick to blame society but refuse to see that ""*we* are society"". behavioral psychology calls this the **""diffusion of responsibility""**—when everyone assumes someone else will take action, no one does. this mindset leads to a vicious cycle: “if others litter, i can too,” perpetuating the problem endlessly.

but here’s the thing: **social change is contagious**. small, consistent actions by a few individuals can influence those around them. your actions, no matter how small, inspire those nearby. you may think nobody gives a f\*ck, but they do, they see, they observe. if you choose to act responsibly, others are more likely to follow. and when you normalize responsible behavior, it grows exponentially.

imagine this: if even 10% of us started using trash bins or stopped littering, it could lead to a visible difference. people wouldn’t see trash around and might hesitate to throw their own. it’s like how a clean, organized room makes you less likely to mess it up, but a messy one makes you think, ""what’s one more item?""

i’m not perfect, but i’ve started carrying my trash until i find a bin. i even pick up litter occasionally when i see it. it’s not much, but it makes me feel like i’m contributing. and honestly, it feels good to *act* instead of complain.

so, next time you think, ""what difference will my actions make?"" remember that change doesn’t happen in a day. but it starts somewhere—why not with us? if you want cleaner streets and a better city, *be the example*. someone’s watching, and you might just inspire them to do the same.

this mindset is not only limited to this one problem . this can apply in many grounds. be it

**caste discrimination:** people blame the system for continuing these divisions, yet many still perpetuate it in their everyday lives through biases, comments, or even who they associate with.

**road safety:** we complain about traffic chaos but then jump signals, don’t wear helmets, or honk unnecessarily. one person following the rules may seem insignificant, but if everyone thought differently, the roads would be safer.

**civic sense:** dirty public spaces, vandalized walls, or spitting on street. it's always someone else’s fault, but it starts with us.

this attitude is kinda similar to the **""bystander effect.""** it’s the belief that others will take responsibility, so we don’t have to. but here’s the harsh truth: if *everyone* thinks this way, nothing changes.

hope we can change our family-&gt;society-&gt;city-&gt;state-&gt;country by adapting these minute things in our life. blaming the government in reddit or any social media is almost like watering a dead plant. neither they see our posts/rant/suggestion, nor they do something progressive about it. so can we discuss on what people can do? 

what do you think? are we just victims of a ""nothing will change"" mindset, or can we actually create a change?"

reddit,2024-12-23 05:15:08,"india is a garbage dump because courts are dysfunctional lately indians are waking up to the fact that we live in a garbage dump and we don't have basic human needs. specially those who have visited anywhere outside india.

aqi is horrible.
water is polluted.
roads are filthy. 
there is dust everywhere. 
open and blocked drainages. smells shit.

people keep on complaining that indians lack civics sense. is fixing above problems people's job or its the job of the people who get our tax money?

now, let's not fool ourselves. if there is no legal accountability why would anyone do their job? 
assume if you can get paid the same salary, infact more, if you don't do your job. would  you still do it?
it's foolish to think that any politician will do.

it's not even a secret. every one knows that 99.9% politicians, ministers are corrupt. they openly take bribes. do corruption in every project or every service. irrespective of which party.

for e.g my city nagar palika didn't even release their balance sheets for last 10 years! how is this not illegal? the fact is it is.

but what can i do? leave my job and go fight court cases for years by spending my hard earned money?

government can make laws that they have made. majority are good. some are bad. what about enforcing these laws? how do we get justice?

if politicians feared justice would they do corruption? everyone knows legal justice is a joke!

our courts are running backlogs of 5 crore cases! huge chunk of people are already dead and they didn't get justice.

if money that was supposed to get spent on that footpath, cleaning that drain went to politican pocket. if we don't have the power to take it out and penalize them. we will remain garbage dump.

now, the question is what can we do? how can we fix courts? how can we make sure that justice is easily achievable at low cost? 

the answer is sadly nothing!"

and if that wasn’t enough, let’s talk about the high-beam warriors. i get it, the road is dark, but driving with high beams on constantly just blinds everyone else. it’s such a nightmare to navigate when you can barely see anything past those blinding lights.

can we collectively petition for better lighting here? or at least spread awareness about the unnecessary use of high beams? this stretch is becoming more of a hassle than it should be.

fellow indiranagar commuters, how are you dealing with this?"

reddit,2024-12-24 18:34:21,"ministry of truth: a reporters' collective investigation on modi government's attempt to manipulate global indices by lobbying international institutions, discrediting global rankings, and trying to create its own rankings &gt; the government wanted the publishers to make critical changes to how they score the countries. one of them was to focus less on malnutrition among children, an indicator where india performed poorly – even by the government's own admission – and dragged down its overall score. the government thought the hunger index was too “biased” towards children and even argued that a large number of infant deaths aren’t actually tied to malnutrition.

&gt; this was not an isolated attempt at influencing a global index. the reporters’ collective investigation has revealed that it is part of a “whole-of-government approach” devised by the prime minister’s office to closely monitor 30 global indices and reach out to agencies that publish the indices to convince them to change their parameters – what they measure –  if india is doing badly in their reports, which it often does.

&gt; to exclusively track these indices, a nodal unit named “global indices for reform and growth” (girg) has been set up. it functions as a perception management agency, complete with a media outreach cell, to manage how india is being talked about and present a rosier picture.

&gt; documents reviewed by the collective show at least 19 union ministries and departments have been tasked to closely monitor what these global indices are saying about india – from the level of hunger in the country, health and education, press freedom to the state of democracy.

&gt; the indian missions abroad too, have been roped in to speak to the publishers of the indices and report back to the government.

**inside modi govt’s war room to whitewash global indices | how the prime minister’s office has ordered a systemic operation to discredit and ‘fix’ global rankings which show the gov’t in bad light. and, to home-cook some charitable replacements.**
https://www.reporters-collective.in/trc/inside-modi-govts-war-room-to-whitewash-global-indices

&gt; it was the season for claims and tall claims. the 2024 parliament elections were three months away. prime minister narendra modi was talking to a gathering in uttar pradesh’s bulandshahr in january. “in the ten years of our government’s rule, 25 crore people — this is a big number — 25 crore people have been lifted out of poverty,” he said.

&gt; the number had been rigged by his government in a pre-planned manner to spruce up its image. 

&gt; this investigation by the reporters’ collective reveals how the dubious statistic was produced as a result of a discreet operation launched on the instructions of the prime minister’s office to counter select global rankings, such as the un’s multidimensional poverty index, in which the indian government scores poorly. 

&gt; in the previous part of this series, we revealed how the government attempted to influence ngos to alter key parameters of the global hunger index to improve india’s ranking. this effort was spearheaded by a dedicated inter-ministerial unit called “global indices for reform and growth” (girg). the unit monitors global indices and engages with publishers to push for methodological changes that favor india’s rankings or orchestrates efforts to discredit the indices while promoting domestically crafted alternatives based on selective data.

&gt; the poverty reduction figure that modi cited during his election campaign came out of one such index the government created, with the help of this unit called girg.

&gt; a senior advisor of niti aayog, government’s top think tank, is on record admitting that under instructions from the top,  the un’s multidimensional poverty index was one of the 30 indices that the government monitored and reviewed, and eventually countered with a self-serving alternative, because it showed india in “poor light”. 

&gt; to whitewash the results and arrive at predetermined findings of lower poverty level, the government picked indicators that would reflect lower levels of poverty in india, and cut down the scores assigned to other indicators, such as child nutrition and health that could show high levels of poverty.

&gt; the result: india’s multidimensional poverty index showed substantially lower levels of poverty in the country than that seen in the global index.

&gt; officials at the government’s think tank niti aayog further extrapolated the already rigged data and claimed 25 crore people had escaped poverty since 2013-14 when narendra modi came to power. they also claimed, based on these projections, that poverty levels would be in single digits by 2024-25.

**to show dramatic reduction in poverty, modi gov’t rigged a homemade poverty index | the homemade poverty index was preordained to show the government in a flattering light, reveals a confidential report. then convenient parameters were cherrypicked to show a lower number of poor. modi flaunted the numbers in the election campaign.**
https://www.reporters-collective.in/trc/to-show-a-dramatic-reduction-in-poverty-modi-govt-rigged-a-homemade-poverty-index

&gt; in february 2020, the cabinet secretary issued a directive to the union legislative department: fix the government’s tarnished reputation on global indices. under the watchful eyes of the prime minister’s office, officials reluctantly began their damage-control mission.

&gt; the culprits were clear. one index accused india of becoming less democratic under prime minister narendra modi’s regime, while another highlighted a troubling indifference to the rule of law. 

&gt; the publishers – one, a us-based non-profit, and the other, an organisation linked to the economist magazine – had failed to appreciate the government’s achievements.

&gt; on the ministry of law and justice’s legislative department hit list were the rule of law index and democracy index. it had to dissect and poke holes in methodologies, question credentials, and, if possible, conjure up friendly homegrown alternatives.

&gt; the mission was simple. convince the publishers to rewrite their rulebook or discredit their findings while presenting better-looking alternatives. 

&gt; but at the ministry of law and justice, the campaign hit an inconvenient bump.

&gt; after scrutinising the methodologies of the offending indices, the ministry’s experts did the unthinkable: they agreed with the conclusions of these indices. official briefing papers not only endorsed the grim findings but went a step further, outlining just how democracy had withered and the rule of law faltered under modi’s watch.

&gt; the assessment, in one part, bluntly concludes: “india’s investigating agencies have become politicised.” 

&gt; this marked perhaps the first internal acknowledgement by the government of the sharp criticism it has faced from opposition parties and civil society organisations, which have long accused agencies like the enforcement directorate of being weaponised against them.

&gt; one of the official briefing papers, on the democracy index, noted, “it may not be out of the context to refer two issues which are (sic) in recent past attracted judicial interventions and need reforms are (i) criminalisation of politics and (ii) expenditure on polls.”

**revealed: when officials admitted india’s rule of law and democracy are failing | ministries pass the buck on democracy and rule of law while quietly acknowledging rising corruption and politicised investigative agencies**

reddit,2024-12-25 17:00:57,"boomer feels? wait for it... since i’m not santa, here’s a nostalgic trip instead of gifts.

	1. 2 rs parle-g biscuits are now 5 rs (i mean the quantity)

	2. 5 rs dairy milk used to feel like luxury with that gold wrapper—now even silk doesn’t get the same treatment.

	3. remember when 20 rs was enough for a plate of chat? now you need at least 50.
	4. golgappa at 10 rs per plate? gone are those goli days

	5. shakalaka boom boom pencils with led lights? lost in dark

	6. school days = pe/pt periods. now, schools don’t even bother with proper playgrounds.

	7. those toy magnets? way bigger and better back in the day along with that electricity kind of sound

	8. kids these days don’t even play with laser pointers anymore.

	9. where’s the iconic mango xerox / kaccha mango bite? feels like it vanished.

	10. 1 rs titbits (okay, the name is questionable now) are only available on amazon—not your local paan shop.

	11. remember those crazy, over-the-top ads? kuchhhh bhiiii

	12. atlas cycles with dynamos—where did they go?

and for all my bangaloreans:
	1. konankunte cross used to be a forest. now it’s home to one of the biggest mall (forum).

	2. the humble manasa theatre (plastic chairs and all) is as fancy as a pvr now.

	3. the once-green kanakapura main road is now filled with buildings 

	4. jp nagar and kalyan nagar are basically the new kora

good times, huh? what are your favorite nostalgia moments?"

reddit,2025-01-02 12:59:14,"i just came back from malaysia first time being to a foreign nation on holidays and my mind was blown.
everything i saw was a stark contrast to what india is. 
in the peak traffic as well people were not honking, not even once.
everyone followed lane discipline. thousands of vehicles and no one was in hurry.
if a construction was going on it was so well maintained that it didn’t even feel like something is under construction. no one was throwing trash around. 

in jam packed places also it was silence, people were not talking loudly, no screaming, things were so calm. except when an indian family or group was around. their presence was felt immediately. one particular group came out with a freaking speaker blaring indian songs and howling like dogs, literally. this group included sophisticated couples and children as well.

i feel the problem is us indians. we, culturally, socially, are so f’ed up that no matter where we are, we create problems and commotion for others.

the moment i landed back i hearer vehicles honking incessantly. no lane discipline. loud noises, high-beams everywhere.

if by magic india gets converted to best infrastructure overnight. best trains, best roads everything. we’ll still be the same chaotic insufferable assh*lls that we are right now. the problem is us. collectively we are the plague of this earth."

this asd never comes if you are paying the bill through bhim app or any other bill payment service, you can find this asd on the physical bill copy or in the websit of bescom 'quick billpay'.

reddit,2025-01-03 19:46:31,"amazon phone delivery scam: mumbai police jai ho! culprits caught within 24 hours  so, here's the probably the final update i'm gonna add for scam, until and unless amazon does some more skullduggery. 

in less than 24 hours after contacting senior police inspector of bangur nagar station, mumbai, mr. anil thakre, he wholeheartedly cooperated with me, and assistant police inspector from cybercell, mr. vivek vijay tambe, got on the case, took my statement and assured me that they'll be caught. 

and guess what, before it was afternoon the next day, they had nabbed culprits, and then before the evening, they had confessions and everything done. phone is untampered and sealed, they'll hand it over to me in a few days after their process is done. 

the delivery guy was opening all secure packages, and the ones that didn't contain anything valuable, they would be sent back marked as refused by customer, which is probably what happened to my previous order of hepa filter which never even got to me. the valuable ones, those he would keep, and if anyone was alerted, he would pass onto someone else, pay them and ask them to deliver it without informing them what's what. that's the case with the second guy who came. that's the official case as it was revealed. 

the first guy who came is the culprit, and his brother actually came to my place pleading, but here's the thing, not only should he have not done that, i can't actually do anything. it's not upto me to take back the fir. i can't. 

this delivery guy has actually done this in the past and amazon refunded the customers, that delivery agency had to shut down. now he was doing it her but was caught because i refused to accept the second parcel. 

amazon's role here is clear though, they're negligent in hiring, ensuring checks on agencies, and then it seems like they got tired of footing the bill for scams, so it has been now been put on the customers. 

which sucks! most definitely. i'll have to consider whether i want to take amazon to consumer court now and spend energy and time there. they even added restrictions to my account even though i was the victim. 

meanwhile, my advice would be if this happens to you, record evidence and go to the police station. not everything is optimally done online. apparently, that includes ordering anything from scamazon now, but okay, go to the station and to the cybercell, and yes, cybercell will also investigate such cases. 

it's upto us now to clean up the act here because amazon has given up it seems. doesn't mean they aren't guilty of negligence and deficiency in service, but that's a consumer court matter. 

i need to sketch and paint some electric pokémon now, and i'll focus on that! ⚡

good luck, and stay safe!"

reddit,2025-01-05 23:11:10,"bescom sent me a 16k electricity bill as the title reads, bescom sent me a sixteen thousand rupee bill for the month of december. my previous bill was of nine hundred rupees.

i am a tenant in a 2bhk flat, living with a roommate with no other fancy luxury other than a fridge and a washing machine, so it was quite shocking to receive such a tremendously high bill. my first instinct was to visit the nearest bangalore one; the lady there told me to go the bescom office stating i might have a faulty meter.

when i went to the bescom office, they checked the bill, most of them shocked at this amount in a normal residential flat.

they sent a line man to check the meter. the line man said that the numbers were correct and i had consumed the said amount of units which was 2500. he noted the b1,b2,b3 values and we headed back to the office.

the officials in the office then checked the online records and said that the meter was showing a lower reading for the past few months, and then this month jumped to the current reading. they said that the people who rented the place before us, might have applied for grihajyoti scheme, and to balance the number of units, the numbers would be manipulated from the consumer end and the official end.

i don't know how much sense to make of that but that was true, for the last few months our units were in 1600s and this month jumped to 1800s but in the values noted by the lineman recorded by the meter, for the last six months the units were in 1800s range.

will be visiting the office again tomorrow as they asked us to submit a letter, let's see what happens.

i just accepted these pothole filled roads and tossed it away as corruption but now i want to take action.

so i am starting out by first understanding who is responsible to maintain this? how do i know that? how do i find out who built it? where to complain? is there an online portal? can we crowd-source build one?"

reddit,2025-01-07 19:12:38,"[rant] bengaluru traffic police: challan first, safety later  here’s what happened to me recently:

i was on whitefield itpl road, heading towards hope farm on my bike. the traffic was crawling, and just after pattandur agrahara metro station, there’s a small cut near brigade bhuwalka icon that leads to ecc road. i saw many people taking that cut, so i checked google maps and decided to take it too since maps were showing 35 mins to reach. the road on the other side was almost empty, so i ended up going around 10 meters on the wrong side.

the moment i turned, two traffic police officers suddenly appeared from their hiding spot behind some parked cars and flagged me down. they stopped the guy in front of me, and me and some others but they drove off before stopping. honestly, i'd realised my mistake as soon as i took that wrong cut, but it felt harmless at that time. well, karma hit instantly and they caught me.

this would have been my first traffic violation in over 10 years of driving. i politely asked the officer if he could give me a warning since it was a first-time mistake. he told me they catch people here daily for the same thing. so, i asked him, ""if this is such a common problem, why don’t you just put up a signboard to warn people?"" his reply? ""why do we need to put a board? you should know it’s wrong.""

i accepted my mistake and tried to reason with him that a simple signboard could prevent so many violations. but nope, he issued a ₹500 challan, and i moved on.

while driving away, i couldn’t stop thinking about how the traffic police here operate. it’s not just bengaluru.even in delhi  they do the same thing. they hide somewhere and suddenly jump out to catch violators instead of preventing violations in the first place.

in many other countries, they put up signboards on highways warning about speed cameras or specific rules. but here, the focus is on collecting fines or worse – other incentives. road safety and rule enforcement feel like an afterthought."

we are **volunteer-based**, and piloting in bangalore at the moment.

we wrote about [undocumented/poorly documented/suppressed information related to filing an rti application](https://zencitizen.in/2024/12/29/what-to-expect-when-you-are-filing-an-rti-application/) that will be of interest to the larger audience here. here's a snippet on how to word an rti request. hope this helps!

*one provision of the rti act prohibits leading or interrogative questions, such as those beginning with ""how"" or ""why."" for instance, instead of asking, ""has the bbmp issued any standard operating procedure for enforcement of zoning regulations?"", you can rephrase it as, ""please provide a copy of the standard operating procedure for enforcement of zoning regulations""*

*note that under the rti act, you cannot request a justification for actions taken by a public authority. for example, ""why did you choose to repair road a instead of fixing pavement b?"" or ""how did you arrive at the conclusion that project a should be prioritized over project b?"" can be reframed as: ""please provide the detailed project reports for project a and project b, if such reports have been prepared.""*

reddit,2025-01-10 13:03:30,"what is the harsh reality of being a 3rd tier college student?  
as a mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering student, you consider yourself elite than the cs/it guys (because they get passing marks easily, and you get more backlogs).

you daydream about clearing the gate examination and landing up in a psu, only to realize a few years later that the cs/it guys have jobs in a corporate environment, while you are operating a machine at a manufacturing unit, dealing with the labors on a construction site or maintaining the electrical components of some machines.

 few choose autocad/plc/scada and later become sales executives because of lower pay. your heart breaks once more - shit, these it guys got girls, chill-college-life, and now a corporate lifestyle. and what did i get? these dust, sweat, and fumes? and that too with a pay scale equivalent to a laborer? ohh, god! you’re so unfair.
 
everyone around you has landed in the college because they could not get a good rank in engineering entrance exams. those guys might not be studious, but teach you to enjoy life with minimum resources. you make a lot of lifetime friends in the hostel.

you’ll find everyone talking about how the future of engineering in india is degrading and how all of us are not going to even get a job of more than 10–15k (which you don’t believe in, till you reach the final year and reality hits you hard).

those campus-placed candidate’s photos you saw on the brochures and hoardings of your college, many of them never got a joining after their so-called campus placement (at least in my college it was so).
mechanical, civil and electrical guys don’t only consider their course structure to be tougher than others, but also convince each other why don’t cs/it girls deserve them.

 brotherhood is at par with the other branches because there are no girls in between. no girl, no fight. 😂😂
you don’t focus on extra-curricular activities much and hence don’t participate or help in organizing them. you lose out more and more chances of your mingle life. also to realize later, how those missed pdp classes, not doing public speaking courses, and ‘other than the study stuff’ are now killing your chances of getting a well-paying job.

you see everyone dreaming for gate, but no one clearing it. you’re depressed. you see someone boasting to refuse a job giving less than 30k salary as fresher and eventually see the same person settling for 10k (justifying they’re doing that job for experience, not money). you’re depressed more.

the couple you thought would be marrying in the future, are separated after college because suddenly the girl found that her father wants a well-settled preferably government employee. and the boy was busy feeding and caring for her baby throughout the college tenure, now baby has grown up and wants a shona who can provide her a better life, because she has compromised a lot in her life being a girl, and doesn’t want to live the same life.

since you have already wasted 4 years of engineering, you would now convince your parents about how the situation of the private sector is too bad in india, and a good government job can be secured by giving ssc/ibps exams in no time, kyuki english aur maths hi to hai, wo bhi basic.

you land up in mukherjee nagar, you see half your college there already. you sit for hours in parks doing long discussions and relive the hostel life in another form. the list and the vicious circle of life go on and on. some of you take the banking path and find a job sooner, some go behind ssc and the results are finalized in another 4 years. some chose ph.d. path, some upsc. some continue, some have to leave in-between. the lifecycle continues depending on one’s financial condition and family support.

though nobody fails at life and eventually finds a way of living, sooner or later. and now you’ve grown up and stop comparing your life with others, because realities of life keep breaking many of your stereotypes (beliefs) time-to-time. you now become mature and start respecting all jobs - be it a shop owner or a school teacher.

ps - these are my personal experience of coming from a tier 3 college in ncr. readers may agree or disagree depending on their personal journey, financial situations, and available guidance. i’m neither criticizing any branch nor promoting any. and yes, i’m from mechanical, so know the pain. 😂😂"

reddit,2025-01-10 23:36:56,"the new thorium era and indian pfbr(prototype fast breeder reactor) thorium is the future of nuclear and it is an accepted fact  
however, we cannot use thorium directly, we need to convert it into uranium u-233 by blasting it with neutrons, it will then absorb a neutron then go through beta decay twice and convert into u-233 which is fissile and can be used in nuclear reactors.  
india right now is leading this race, the pfbr(prototype fast breeder reactor) is already ready and is at the last stages of final checks and tests, after these checks are complete in around late 2025, it will reach criticallity, that is fuel loading will start.  
many articles claim that this reactor will only breed more plutonium pu-239 from uranium u-238, which is in fact true, but there is a concrete evidence that thorium th-232 will also be converted into uranium u-233, it is because it has the only operational reactor in the world that is based on u-233(for generating electricity)

also what makes this reactor different from the american one which was tested in late 1950s is that the pfbr is liquid sodium cooled and the american one was molten salt cooled

there is also one more point about this reactor, it is that it breeds more fissile material than it requires as an input.  
in conclusion, we can say that the pfbr will breed plutonium pu-239 from uranium u-238; and it will also breed uranium u-233 from thorium th-232

it will also be the first operational and commercial reactor in the world that will breed u-233 from th-232  

also the pfbr will have a capacity to generate 500mw of energy, after pfbr will be a success, india will make a fleet of fbr's(fast breeder reactors)

reddit,2025-01-13 13:26:25,"how are various indian electrical utilities (private) and psu discoms dealing with the increasing share of renewables in the grid and the unpredictability and lack of 24x7 supply?  so, it has been a fact that the indian electrical grids are getting cleaner. whichever of the 5 regional grids you want to consider, all of them are getting greener, either through newer nuclear power being brought online, coal fired thermal stations being critical, supercritical, or ultra supercritical, or even natural gas based cogeneration plants now operational in or near industrial zones.

the share of zero emission renewables (only solar, and wind really qualify here, as hydro has emissions from the decay of natural vegetation and release of other greenhouse gases, for a significant period even after reservoir submersions) is increasing across all 5 regional grids.

how are regional grids balancing out the solar availability of only 7-9 hours per day, and wind being unavailable during low or very high wind speeds when the turbines are offline? the grid demand doesn't change according to the availability, so how are grids managing this?

there is a ton of literature available online on what is happening in us and europe, japan, australian region, and in latin america, but extremely low information about the electrical markets in china (only a few regional government press releases and on big large projects, acknowledgement from beijing), india and africa.

so, my question is for people who are knowledgeable about happenings in the indian electrical grid - how are the indian grid and indian regional grids dealing with increasing renewables share to maintain grid stability and robustness?

is it through a higher number of gas peaker plants?
is it through bess options? (afaik, bess adoption is still low in india due to higher capital costs)
is it through reducing base load nuclear and thermal plants during the day/optimal windspeed times and then ramping them up for needs during lack of solar or lack of wind power?
is it through importing more electricity from other neighboring nations?"

**snip** *transferring a bescom connection can be initiated online, but there are no significant advantages to doing so. we recommend opting for the offline approach, as it is more efficient.* **snip**

\-------

**snip** you need a printout of the photo of electricity meter (ensure visibility of the serial number and latest reading of units consumed), and the meter box cover (ensure visibility of the revenue registration/rr number)

* if the meter does not display the reading, press the button on the meter a few times until it shows the current reading.
* ensure the meter reading reflects the most recent consumption, ideally taken no more than 2-3 days before submitting the application—preferably after the date of your last bill. this helps verify that the photo you’re providing matches the meter installed at the property listed in the address proof.

context: ideally, the junior engineer (je) should inspect the meter in person to confirm its accuracy. however, this step is often substituted by reviewing a photo of the meter provided by the citizen. when the reading in your photo aligns with the most recent electricity bill you’re submitting, it reassures the staff that the meter in the picture is indeed the correct one.

if the meter reading does not match or is outdated, you may be required to visit the office again with an updated photo of the latest reading. **snip**

reddit,2025-01-18 23:02:26,"why are we so unbothered? when will we start holding people in power accountable? hey redditors,

i’ve been thinking a lot lately about the state of civic accountability in india and wanted to hear your thoughts on this. why do we, as a society, seem so unbothered by issues that directly affect us?

from pollution and lack of civic sense to electing criminals into power (irrespective of party affiliations), it feels like there’s a collective apathy. why are we not questioning those in power? why are we not demanding better governance?

i get that most of us are in “hyper-awareness mode” just trying to get by—paying bills, commuting through chaos, securing education and healthcare, etc. but when does this survival mode end? when do we start addressing the bigger systemic issues?

take pollution, for instance. cities like mumbai and delhi are choking with dangerous aqi levels. yet, there’s little outrage. we’ve normalized garbage burning, unregulated construction dust, and vehicular emissions. even the basics like segregation of waste or following traffic rules seem too much for us as a society.

let’s talk about governance. why are we electing individuals with criminal charges into office repeatedly? across all political parties, the data is staggering, yet we shrug it off as if it doesn’t matter. is it because we’ve resigned ourselves to “sab corrupt hai” (everyone’s corrupt)?

we’ve seen moments when people came together—candle marches for the nirbhaya case, protests against environmental damage, movements like anna hazare’s anti-corruption campaign. yet, these waves of outrage fade over time, and we return to the status quo. why?

when will it be the right time for people to wake up? what’s the breaking point? will it take an environmental disaster, collapsing infrastructure, or worsening public health to shake us?

i’m not here to point fingers. i’m just trying to understand. are we too focused on survival to care? are we afraid of change? or do we simply feel powerless in the face of deeply entrenched systems?

i’d love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and any ideas on what could spark sustained change. what’s stopping us from holding people in power accountable, and how can we start breaking this cycle?

looking forward to an open and honest discussion.

what do you think?"

reddit,2025-01-19 12:20:19,"a possible (partial) solution to india's garbage problem so, in my view one of the reasons the mindset issue of cleanliness is not being solved just by expecting behavioral change is because for most people the incentive is not strong enough. a punishment or fine might also not be effective because of the challenges of implementing it and the fact that it is by nature painful, which relies on discipline rather than reward.

what might work is pfand. pfand or ""deposit"" is a system in germany whereby people can get money for depositing their waste. there are machines installed all around, in most supermarkets, where anyone can drop in an empty plastic, glass bottle or aluminum can, and the system pays back an average of 15-20 cents per item. it is common for people to deposit their waste bottles and cans in bulk and use their returned voucher of a 5-10 euro for grocery shopping right away. the machines crush the plastic immediately and prepare it for recycling which can be collected regularly.

similar machines could be installed in public places in major indian cities. as an alternative, human operated kiosks could also be set up. the price per bottle could be made attractive enough for people to incentivise collecting trash. it may need subsidies from the government initially. the system could also be expanded to include general plastic waste by kilo and pay back a decent amount. 

why this would be a good idea is that it challenges the notion that dealing with waste is just a ragpicker's job, and takes away the stigma around it. it offers a strong and direct incentive that doesn't rely on just good behaviour and generates a reward proportional to the amount of garbage collected - it makes trash valuable. it helps with the centralized garbage disposal system, with the segregation and recycling of plastic etc. it also provides a supplement income for the poor. in germany it is not uncommon to see homeless or poor people rummaging through the trash to search for these plastic bottles.

i emailed wbsedcl which is a govt owned company in wb which provides electricity to 96% of bengal. i sent them an email (pic attached above) suggesting some improvement in their service and to my surprise in 5 months they took everything very positively and implemented most of my suggestions(image proof attached above)

the entire credit goes to wbsedcl and their employees for bringing so many great upgrades to their system and improving their service. it maybe that these were already in their pipeline but an app getting an update after 4+ years after someone complained doesn't seem like a coincidence to me. i emailed them on august 2024 and 5 months is enough time to upgrade the app when most features already exist so i believe i was the catalyst for change.

q. why is it such a big thing?
a. nothing in india gets fixed without complaints. if you complain/register a docket for power cut, i can guarantee you the power will be back in 15 mins. i have been doing the same and get back power within 15 mins. they are required to fix powercut asap if you complain as the complaints are monitored and alarms go off if they don't. if you don't complain then they will fix it at their leisure. give it a try.

q. whom did i write the email and whom did i send it?
a. i generated the email using chatgpt and then i searched everyone related wbsedcl like the cc, ministry of power, cmo, power secretary, all the officers and peoples email mentioned on their website and on the internet, took me just 5 mins to find them and send this email

even if 1% of the 2 crore wbsedcl users use these services, it would benefit 2 lakh people. the 2.03 crore are just users with machine registered on their name, considering each family has 5 members, this helps improve services to potentially 10 crore people in west bengal.

moral of the story - the govt will work, the govt will listen to you if you speak up and get your voices heard to the right people. emails are a superpower each and every citizen has. use chatgpt create an email and start complaining and improving services around you. 5 mins of my time improved services to 2 crore people. imagine what we can achieve if everyone starts spending 5 mins emailing every weekend to improve roads, clean city, build parks etc."
reddit,2025-01-22 16:59:14,"indians should be waiting on red hi guys, this is a retelling from an article from a danish popular programmer from an indian perspective. please take this as a constructive criticism and not a doomer rant. will also attach a tldr;  at the end.

the danes follow laws even when no one is looking and none will be harmed if you do not follow rules at that particular time. we see a comparison of americans and danes. americans follow the spirit of the law following is most of the time. almost always when there are stakes or it could be harmful to self or anyone else. however david(author) argues that this is not enough . it is not enough to follow rules and law most of the time. it is imperative to follow all the time.

in india, rules often feel more like suggestions. every individual operates in a state of perpetual ""prisoner's dilemma,"" constantly second-guessing others' actions. for instance:

* should you let a pedestrian cross, or risk being cut off by the car behind you?
* should you clean the road outside your house, knowing it will likely be dirtied again by others?

contrast this feeling with american experience you can assume most will not take your spot. they will wait for you to cross the road (mostly). however let's take it up a notch in denmark this is the default. the public life can be lived in 'autopilot'. you can definitely assume most people will follow the rules so we can assume people will wait for cars and cars will wait for people. on a sidenote the pedestrian has the right of the way so cars should wait mostly.

this is obviously not just people. it's also the education system that didn't emphasised civic sense. people taught us to love our country. but none taught us to love our fellow citizen mostly because the citizen was always divided into a neat vote bank of religion/caste/language/ state. none taught us to love our district, city or state. the state( the government is a instance of state i'm talking about it in abstract) failed to educate and enforce the offence.

you might think minor infarctions are okay to let go. it's okay to speed a bit over the limit. it's okay to drive in wrong lane or footpath if the road is too busy to navigate. it is not. it normalises bad behaviour. i do not know how much you've experienced this but in my experience ever fifth indian i see has a god complex. if it's okay for you an average person(/s) to break a few rules, imaging what this god man can do; sky is the limit.

don't think this article is about the friendly thar driver. well it is, but not just about him. i'm also targeting the little guy/gal. little guy also need to be punished sometimes. the problem with this is how much can you punish a person who is already down. and lot of people are already down in this country. how can you possible fine a person thousands who earns that much in a month?

to this i say your empathy is suicidal. this is a fundamental error. empathy for repeat offenders often leads to a deteriorating quality of life for everyone.. your tolerance for people has made your own life miserable. uncleanliness breads contempt and disgust in yourself and the people around you. and there are more than one ways to rehabilitate not just fines but the state just finds it easiest to levy fines or take bribes instead. there social services, cleaning services one just has to get off their get their hands dirty. you or your caste might disagree with me but everyone needs to clean.

the veneer of civil society is extremely thin and it's paper thin in india.

my context - i've lived in east delhi in fairly good condition but i've seen nearby places so i have first hand experience. however now i'm loving in europe and people are just nicer here.  
it does not feel like people are out to get you on road. i pay high tax but the clean air and roads makes it worth it. interest rate here is \~2%. i mention this because this shows the trust in people and the land.

tldr;  
india desperately needs a cultural shift toward civic sense and rule-following. this is a call to action for everyone to lead by example and strive for change.

america sets a decent standard, but as the danish author suggests, perfection—or at least striving for it—should be the goal.

reddit,2025-01-24 14:56:37,"seniors (45+), was life in metro cities any better in the 2000s? hey everyone,

i’m in my early 30s, and lately, i’ve been feeling frustrated with the way things are in the country, especially in cities like chennai. growing up, we lived in central government quarters, so i didn’t deal with a lot of the issues i’m facing now. but after building our own home recently, i had to interact with state government employees (corporation, eb, etc.), and honestly, it was such a frustrating experience.

i live about an hour away from work, and the state of the roads and public transport is just terrible. there’s barely any government-maintained infrastructure — no proper parks, no clean beaches, nothing. chennai feels like one giant garbage bin, and whenever i travel to other cities, i notice the same thing. add to that the traffic, corruption, unattended crimes, and a general lack of vision for the future, and it feels really bleak.

i know the internet amplifies everything these days, and we’re more aware of issues happening in every corner of the country. but i wonder — was it always like this? seniors in this group (45+), i’d love to hear your take:

1. how were metro cities like chennai, bangalore, or delhi in the 2000s?
2. did you feel hopeful about the country’s growth back then?
3. was corruption, poor infrastructure, and inefficiency just as bad, or does it only feel worse now because we’re more connected through the internet?

i have a good job and a great family here, and i never thought about leaving india in my 20s. but now, with everything i deal with daily — corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of progress — i’m seriously considering moving abroad.

did you ever feel this way, or was there something about the country that kept you hopeful?"

here’s what i’m thinking: a **private ac bus service** that actually works for us.

* pick-ups and drop-offs at spots you can easily walk to
* comfy 12/21-seater buses
* no fancy app (yet)—just a simple whatsapp or google form to book

reddit,2025-01-24 23:19:23,"can someone explain the lack of indian artisans? i've travelled to multiple cities in south india and visited many temples. around every temple there are tens if not hundreds of people trying to sell plastic junk or bad copper statues, machine-made and hurtful to the eye. all this stuff is cheap, machine made, some of it coming from aliexpress or other similar sources. what baffles me is how hard these people try to sell their garbage (this is not craft, and this is what this question is about), while not seeing the obvious - there is no demand. many foreign tourists come to india to visit the temples and what the experience mostly is a brutal assault of these rude sellers.

india has a long legacy of highly skilled artisans, masters of their craft. why are not these people in high density places, where tourists would love to buy a high quality souvenir, a statue or painting? where are the indian artists and why are touristic places so suffocatingly oversaturated with low quality ware?

hey guys want to share another great news this weekend with you guys. if you remember, [i shared last week how i got wbsedcl to improve their service with my email](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1i4yc3p/i_potentially_improved_the_lives_of_203_crore/). i travelled last month via a newly built expressway in wb. i rarely use this road but its very well made expressway. a huge shoutout to wbhdcl(west bengal highway authority) for making such an amazing expressway.

while travelling i found a issue on the entire stretch of the highway. the highway was not maintained very well. the highway was collecting dust and white sand and was accumulating on the side of the highway and when cars used to go at high speed, it was being spread on the road back again which was causing skidding in vehicles. this was a serious issue and though i don't use it much i thought i should inform about this to wbhdcl to help reduce accidents. i wrote a small complain with some suggestions to clean the road daily and buy cleaning machine to properly handle dust and sand accumulation on the road via cpgrams portal. 

i visited the expressway this week and saw people cleaning and collecting dust with broom and hand shovel at a crossing. i was happy to see it but i thought it would have been better if they used cleaning machines but atleast they are cleaning it now. 10km ahead i saw it, a road cleaning machine attached to a tractor, it wasn't the modern cleaning machines seen in the city but it was not spreading the dust and sand and actually picking it properly(pic attached, not original pic but similar, as i wasn't able to stop and take pic on expressway) i was so happy to see the road lanes cleared of sand. i complained to them a month ago and they actually took it positively and took action. the expressway has been open for quite a few months but this is the first time i saw cleaning machines deployed. it is highly possible that they already had plans on cleaning the roads but i never saw it cleaned before i complained so i believe my suggestions nudged them to take action to clean the road and prevent accidents. there is still a lot of sands at merging intersection and some other parts of the expressway but the main highway and its sidelines are mostly clean now, hoping they keep it up and clean everything soon.

moral of the story - if you find a problem please take action, please complain to the correct authority, please do something. if nothing just shoot an email to the govt, 80% chance they won't check it but the other 20% is a big deal, what if they actually read it and get it fixed like the above case. my complaint possibly saved hundreds from accident as roads are clean and free of sand. if you are stuck in traffic, have roads filled with potholes, garbage on the road etc. don't sit back and accept it, tell the govt you want it fixed, they will fix things when people actually demand it. 

my reason for sharing all these things are to show the people how easy it can be to bring change, you might not even have to step out of your home to bring change and improve lives of lakhs of people in india, all i ask you is to be selfish and complain for the things that only matter to you, complain for only the roads you travel by, cleanliness in the area you travel by daily. i see people thinking i am some activist trying to bring change but that is far from the truth. i am a simple man working 9-5 with no connections or influence. all that is different between me and the rest is that when i face a problem like bad roads, potholes, garbage problem etc, i take 5 mins out of my time and tell the govt there is a problem and ask them to fix it. i don't go around fixing all the problems in wb or banglore or any other state when i visit it, all i try to fix are the things that bother me, if everyone does the same, every neighbourhood would improve drastically in india."

both parties have made multiple attempts to have the trees cut down. once we even had to fight the family because the resident was literally up on a neem tree and cutting a branch himself. 
turns out the mcf guys visited today (not sure if this is true), and said they need to cut some branches because they are touching the electricity grid wires. well, okay. assuming it is true, fine. 
but. 
they have clearly cut so much more than necessary. trees that did not even have any branches touching or near the wires have been cut down. 
i spoke to the people cutting it down and they said that some was for the mcf work, but the society families have also come and requested them to cut extra without telling anyone. 

what can i do here? 

it's painful to see. it's so incredibly wrong. 20+ years of strong, beautiful, lush green trees just cut down. these stupid men and women don't realise that these very trees provided shade in summers, which are increasingly unbearable each year.

recently, a lady police officer has moved in to our apartment to what is called pent house which is basically a unit in the apartment terrace.she seems to cause a lot of nuisance.
she lives with her kids and one of her kids is a mannerless brute. they are causing many problems in the apartment.

-- problem no.1 and the main problem is that they waste a lot of water. the terrace has a common washing area for clothes for everyone in the particular block to use.
the kids just turn the tap on and run out all the stored water. most people from neighbouring roads and neighbouring blocks have spotted them red handed in the act. yet, when asked upfront , the police lady asks for proof and usually responds only using lewd unparliamentary language. 
a neighbour of mine who is a celebrated teacher at a prestigious school of the vicinity, once tried to have a dialogue with her about the water issue. the police lashed out at her using lewd language and even went to the extent that after the argument, she posted a whatsapp status addressing about how the teacher was mannerless and how could such a person teach manners to younger children.
i wonder how this lady is supposed to help people as a police personnel.

--problem no.2 pertaining to the use of lewd language and unnecessary arguments and fights, it's not just for people who address the issues. she lashes out at every other random person for the slightest of whatever she finds as ""pressing issues"" like the other day she lashed out at the flower hawker because his screaming for calling out customers was disturbing her. 

she has even used the minority card once when there was absolutely no necessity for it in front of people who frankly didn't even give two cents of attention to things like caste, creed to evade out of issues.
she being a police tried to incite communal issues just so she could stand out as the winner of some sorts.
this all she being a police personnel.

the thought of picking up a fight with her has crossed my mind a thousand times, yet i choose to be the bigger person and deal with this in a lawful manner exactly as opposite to whatever this hooligan in the form of a police stands for.

if anyone even has the slightest idea on how to handle this situation in a very diplomatic, judicial and lawful way, please let me know so that i can atleast put a stop to this two faced hooligan's play.

thank you."
reddit,2025-01-29 06:08:09,"the bbmp's 40ft road rule for shops isn't the solution - here's what we should do instead yesterday, bbmp announced they won't renew trade licenses for shops on roads narrower than 40ft in residential areas (established after 2015). while i understand the intention to manage traffic and maintain residential character, i believe this binary approach is problematic and there's a better solution: pedestrianization.

why the current approach is flawed:

1. it's a sledgehammer approach to a nuanced problem. not all sub-40ft streets are the same - some might be perfect for local shops while others aren't.

2. it hurts local businesses that make our neighborhoods more liveable. think of your favorite local bakery or convenience store - they actually reduce car trips by letting people walk to get basic necessities.

3. it's historically been poorly enforced (as noted by i change indiranagar), which means we're just creating more informal/illegal businesses rather than solving the actual problems.

a better solution: pedestrianization with limited vehicle access

instead of banning businesses outright, we should:

1. convert narrow residential streets into pedestrian-priority zones where cars are guests. this is called ""shared space"" design or ""woonerf"" - it's been hugely successful in cities from amsterdam to tokyo.

2. allow local businesses but with strict guidelines on delivery timing, waste management, and noise levels. this maintains the residential character while preserving useful amenities.

3. use design elements like traffic calming such as different paving, planters, and street furniture to naturally slow traffic and make the space more people-friendly.

real-world examples we can learn from:
- church street's pedestrianization experiment is showing great results
- commercial street's partial pedestrianization

instead of killing our neighborhood shops with blanket bans, let's create streets that work for everyone. while bbmp remains fixated on maximizing vehicle throughput, cities worldwide have proven that prioritizing people over cars creates more vibrant, liveable neighborhoods. bengaluru deserves better than outdated car-centric planning.

i have been saying this repeatedly - let’s start sending emails and letters to our respective mlas and mps to pressure them to apply pressure on the government in the state assembly and parliament.

reddit,2025-01-29 21:52:05,"if i had a magic wand to completely reform india, the few changes i would bring: these are personally my views, in which if i had an opportunity to reform india, i would implement said changes. i would like to point out none of my policies align with a specific party but rather substantiate my points with data, experts analysis, and issues which are close to my heart. i would appreciate constructive criticism on any positions, give me a differing opinion or add on to the list:

1. make the acb (anti corruption board) a completely independent body out of the arms reach of the legislative and executive. it would be monitored by a body of supreme court judges where they have the complete liberty and freedom to conduct raids on politicians, ministers and judges. daily quotas on raiding houses of suspects and special acb courts to keep financial accountability of politicians. auditing of accounts at random, special house-checks at random which is streamed live and a mandatory publicised questionnaire on assets and liabilities to enhance accountability in video-format. including ruling party and non-ruling party members.
2. reinstate njac, to ensure nepotism does not occur at the sc/hc level. cji, lop and pm in the 3-member appointment committee. a secretariat established at the ministry of law and justice with minutes of meetings be publicly displayed.
3. productivity-based incentives for public employees, and removal of job securities. need to work hard to be paid equally well. this will ensure complete efficiency in all governmental sector jobs and public jobs. promotions on basis of targets and productivity solely. basically corporatising all govt  depts. to maximise efficency
4. every minister on a video-format on a daily basis should give a 10-15 minute briefing on every action which they took that day, why they took that, and what plans are they taking on issues which fall under their department. a  cabinet press-conference should be conducted on a weekly basis for a minimum of 2 hours where questions are asked to the minister on basis of the expertise of the issue, and questions taken on the pm.
5. specialisations in bureaucracy where transfers need to be capped at a minimum of  2-per year and inter-departmental transfers do not take place. a minimum time of each member in said position should be for 2.5 years to ensure that long-term institutional memory takes place and ias officers are specialists instead of generalists. lateral entry should be allowed in every dept/ ministry to fill up positions and separation of ias, ips, ifs and other class-a officers into different examinations. increasing the number of officers at the grass root level to ensure that 1 ias officer every 10,000 citizens.
6. introduction of non creamy layer in sc &amp; st's to ensure that educationally empowered and financially well-off families do not take away seats which are needed for socially, educationally and financially-backward houses. removal of reservations in government professions  especially at drdo, isro and other institutions of critical importance.
7. introducing an additional district court, every district, increasing judicial capacity and creating more vacancies in judiciary positions in order to alleviate the backlog of 45 million cases. introducing fast-track courts every district for discharging justice on severe offense (rape, murder, sexual harassment etc.,) and creation of ad-hoc courts for petty offenses over a minimum threshold level. this is to alleviate. i believe these measures will also not suffice in bringing the courts to par with the incoming cases.
8. severe investments into public transport at every metropolitan city by ensuring every metropolitan city has metro connectivity of a minimum 350 kilometers (similar to delhi) and a intra-city rail connectivity connecting less-dense and upcoming areas of the city. the minimum travel time once reduced to half present, investment into creating more road infrastructure should be presented.
9. complete decentralisation in which local municipal boards and gram panchayats get a minimum of 50% of the indian budget.  local boards focus on cleanliness, hygiene, sanitation, health and education at every city should be provided with targets, and target-measure mechanisms adopted and actions taken be publicised on a daily level to ensure appropriate public scrutiny occurs.
10. a cap on each mp/mla/alderman/gram panchayat to stand in elections for two terms, to ensure incumbency-fatigue  and monopolisation of power does not occur.
11. remove all non-essential  into subsidies (ranging from ladli behen/ gruha lakshmi, free electricity crap all the way to subdisdised electricity to farmers) every dollar removed from subsidies would be reinvested in r&amp;d and other infrastructure for technology and other science-field innovations. this will plug the cognitive drain and bolster india to be a tech-leader far after china and us. 
12. reducing the tax burden on the middle class, and the 1% of indians who pay tax, penetrating the taxation into the informal and unorganised sector via a series of measures (making it mandatory to except upi payments, keeping a good check of the hoards of black money) this will increase the amount of people under the tax system, increase govts revenues (many panipuri walas/ chaiwalas are earning a good 10lpa and not paying any tax.) this revenue could be better utilised for critical sectors which require funds. (aim is to get the top 10% of indians under taxation) 
13. recognise top talents in every field across the world, pay exorbiant amount of salaries to them bring them to india, find top talent indians and cater them to work together for an exchange of knowledge in fields india could pioneer and advance in. complete govt. funding and ownership of emerging technologies (priority in critical and defense tech.)
14. stop constructions of new govt. schools, redirect all funds into quality improvisation of existing govt. schools, bring all state-sponsored education under cbse board, who will appoint teachers on performance basis, incorporate atal thinking labs and a holistic quality education based on experiential learning in every rural school.  a minimum 10% budget directed to education (uphold the spirit of art 21a.) (aim is to blur the lines b/w a private and a govt. school)
15. remove ugc, enhance the purview of cbse to all educations, and a centralised education system in all universities where the courses, curriculum, experiments, internships are all detaily outlined by the board, every semester examination/oral examination should be standardised in every field in every university across the country. abolish deemed university concept, all engineering, medical, paramedical, arts degree should follow one high quality education with textbooks and sources of the govt.

where they first vaccum sand dust small debris garbage from the road and then wash the road with treated sewage water daily this process shall mostly be done in midnight time 

using water sprinklers on construction sites for the dust to settle just like the process done in mines 

imposing strict rules like mandatory covering the  construction raw materials while transit 

imposing more strict rules on garbage collection and imposing heavy fines on people who litter the public space. 

as dust due to the ongoing construction is the most contributing factor  for the worse air quality

using scr technology( selective catalytic reduction) and additonal exhaust filter 

which includes retrofitting adblue or def tank to private and commercial  diesel and petrol vehicles which would reduce the emission alot and would not cause a economic disruption which would be cause by the bullshit rule of banning diesel and petrol vehicles or the bullshit odd even rule imposed in delhi 


this implementation would only need costs or fitting the adblue  setup additional exhaust filters and adblue refilling points which can be easily placed at every petrol pump present in mmr and save the public from the economic disruption caused due to switching to ev's


sustainable transport initiative by discontinuing off all the diesel and cng buses and transition to 100 percent ev buses 


discontinuing use of diesel engines for shunting duties at major railway stations like csmt mct dadar terminus bandra terminus and using electric locomotives 

artificial seeding everybody knows this process but if anyone who doesn't know no problem 

artificial cloud seeding, also known as weather modification or artificial rainmaking, is a technique that enhances precipitation by introducing chemicals into clouds. the goal is to change the natural development of clouds to increase rain, reduce hail, and dissipate fog and to increase the aqi . 

chemicals like silver iodide, potassium iodide, dry ice, or liquid propane are dispersed into clouds. 
these chemicals act as ice nuclei, which attract water vapor and help form ice crystals. 
the ice crystals grow and become heavy enough to fall as rain or snow. 

	effectiveness of cloud seeding: studies show that cloud seeding can enhance rainfall and reduce pollutants like dust and particulate matter in the air.

edit: thanks all good people for your critical comments and a possible way around.

this seems unfair—shouldn’t they cut power only for the defaulters instead of affecting multiple households? is there any official rule that allows bescom to do this, or is this an overreach?"
reddit,2025-01-30 14:33:41,"the times of india editorial: unofficial apologist, trivialiser and victim-blamer for the bjp https://preview.redd.it/ik920hwpl2ge1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=562fecf96afc558e0b6a74208d8509b8993a1408

this is a reproduction of the times of india editorial from today, jan 30th, 2025. as a toi reader for decades, it pains the heart that the broadsheet has been reduced to playing daily defense for the government. 

we seem to have ventured upon a new season of craven sycophancy where editorials provide clean chits to power - and pass the blame onto anyone that doesn't possess it or is a victim of its inefficiency.

https://preview.redd.it/2ypcvbz5q2ge1.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99b1f9ef503caafab5ce90b32d7b4c124141d03e

what is this 'perspective' that toi is trying to peddle here? ""some disorder is inevitable?"" what the fuck is that supposed to even mean? is it toi, the government or the bjp that is going to set an acceptable degree of the 'inevitable' for us plebs to manage our faulty perspectives?

""a kumbh stampede is big news but hey look so many people went back without dying."" 

this is a piece of logical assholery, an appeal to probability. here, the toi editorial shamelessly normalizes  organizational mismanagement and takes for granted the loss of indian lives, by cleverly highlighting that negative outcomes were probable!

this is an indictment of indian media and a self-goal for toi. mainstream media in india has long abandoned all pretense of reporting anything that is relevant and substantive for the common man. 

they are the industry, they know that the gruesome, hateful and salacious will always outsell substance and they pander - because that is the mo of their political masters. that is their way. 

i think there is also an underlying realization that their ilk is incapable of creating anything engaging and substantive in any case. so someone settled down post-dinner, cracked their knuckles and typed out this 300-word piece of shit.

a word of advice to toi hr; you need to immediately reevaluate the newsroom banter (and get them to stop deriving from pedophilic sayings like 'if it bleeds, it breeds'). 

on a serious note, after abdicating their responsibility to journalism, toi is brazenly trolling and blaming its audiences. the usage of phrases like 'sense of drama', 'mass media', 'news is played up' suggests the writer is having an out-of-body sleep paralysis-like experience. 

maybe they are also powerless, maybe they too can see that what's happening isn't right. only they have emis to pay and can't stop repeating bullshit like 'conjunction of the two is not antithetical' like a cut-rate corporate-approved ai. 

this editorial made me angry while reading it and it makes less sense each time i glance at it."
reddit,2025-01-31 03:09:36,"resident welfare associations have gone out of hand! i feel like resident welfare associations in india have gone out hand, going on crazy power trips and imposing all sorts of rules and requirements on people, some of which even go against the laws of the country!

for example, we are now shifting from a place we were renting in an apartment building, to an apartment we own in a gated community. we have pet cats as well.

some 2 days ago, i brought 3 of my cats to the place we own. went to the lift to use it (i have a knee injury so i can't climb the stairs). they were doing ""maintenance"" which was just sweeping the elevator shaft. said it wouldn't be available for an hour! i complained, and the guy went off somewhere and then came back and offered to help me carry my pets to my floor. so i did that (of course this damaged my knee). then when i came back out the lift was working. so i went down in it, came back to get my 3rd cat. when i went back to the lift, it was not working again. so i started complaining out aloud. one aayaah was sweeping nearby, she asked what's the matter i told her.

while i was talking to her, some guy was walking by. upon seeing me he came and asked what's the matter. i told him lift is not working. he said ""it's in maintenance just accept it"" in a very rude and abusive tone. i told him it's not actually in maintenance, it's working fine, i just came down in it. then he started shouting ""mind your language"" ""mind your language"" as if i'd said something bad. i was tired (i have life threatening chronic fatigue of which i am dying). it was hot. i have sleep apnea and my spo2 went down to 76% for 7 minutes the previous night (which means a bunch of my body cells died the previous night and i am triply tired). so i got angry and told him, ""sir i don't care about your language, please fuck off"".

at which point this guy got triggered and started shouting and screaming at me like a crazed and insane person. started shouting madarchod madarchod and then blamed me claiming i started the problem. he started shouting and screaming like crazy came right upto my face to scream in my face, to beat me! i got scared. meanwhile people living on the 1st floor came down to see the commotion. this fucker is still screaming at me, threatening to beat me! he said he was part of the association committee, he would call security and have me removed. he felt confident in his ability to abuse me, beat me and get away with it.

finally my mother came down and helped carry up the cat and dragged me away.

i'm planning to go file a police complaint, i wish i had called 100 and got this fucker arrested then and there. but i was rattled, tired and annoyed so i didn't do it then. and my poor cat who was in her cage right next to me all the time was traumatised by this pos.

now yesterday, we went back to the old apartment to finish painting, repair work, throw trash and gather up belongings. went around bought stuff, ate, went and bought some things i needed. came back to the building for the final part which was to bring stuff we carried to our new home, including our cycles. only to find that the rwa secretary had disabled the lift and prevented everyone in the building from using it! it was a crazy situation. i asked the watchman why, he blamed a mr.anand on the 1st floor. i went there with anger and asked about it, his wife answered and said they didn't know anything about it. then watchman says it's actually the secretary mr. rajesh who locked the lift. then one fucker on the 2nd floor, comes and starts arguing with me and justifying the decision to lock the lift!

we lived on the 3rd floor in that old apartment. i have a knee injury. we have to carry heavy items down. my father has parkinsons and loses balance easily. he simply cannot walk down 3 flights of stairs safely. and this rajesh guy is refusing to enable the lift. he claims we damaged it when moving furniture. except just some 2-3 weeks prior, some office on the 2nd floor was moving furniture, they happily kept the lift blocked, and damaged it and he never disabled it for them. but only for us.

the same bastards move their furniture in the lift all the time - this anand and rajesh shouted and screamed at us to do termite treatment several months ago because their precious wooden furniture was being destroyed (we had zero termite problems). we had to undergo a lot of hassle and pain, renting an airbnb for a few days to keep the cats and ourselves which cost us 36000 inr! and keeping all of our things safe (we all have health problems including my mother with lymph node inflammation and my brother with an injured spine).  and these same fuckers happily used the lift then to move their termite ridden furniture, damaging it happily.

and now they do illegal things like preventing us from using the lift. we paid 50000 inr per month for that apartment. and we got treated like garbage.

the rwa secretaries think they are kings presiding over their own kingdoms who can do whatever they want with no consequences. they think the law doesn't apply to them. fuck rwa. time to destroy them all.



edit: update to this first part where the rwa intentionally and illegally blocked all deliveries, including medicine, foo, drivers, repairmen etc. we went to the police, police came and warned the association to unblock us immediately or else.

so yeah, if they ever cause such problems, go the police. if local police station doesn't help, find out where the assistant commissioner of police for your locality is, and then go to them."

reddit,2025-02-05 12:16:02,"magic pin... not so magic long post alert!!!

so this happened a couple of days back. my husband had placed an order at connie's steak house through the magic pin app. after almost 45 minutes of wait, we realise the delivery partner (let's call him a) assigned, has now been changed and we have a new person (b) assigned. 

by now, it's almost an hour of wait since placing the order, so we called up the delivery partner and b tells us that he's almost at the restaurant and it's not his fault that magic pin messed up with the delivery partner assignment earlier (he just got assigned to the job, so as to speak). we kindly told him we understand, just wanted to get to know what's actually happening at the ground, and got off the call. note in all this mess, we have no way to contact the magic pin customer care.

few minutes later b called us back saying the restaurant is actually not positioned at the point where it's shown on the map. to get to the actual place, he would have to go a further 2 kms and also, it's on the other side of the road. we contacted the restaurant and they confirmed what b said. according to them they had moved, and their new location has been updated on swiggy and zomato, magic pin is yet to do the same. however, when we told about the extra 2km charge that b had complained (50 rupees), they offered to compensate that amount directly to b for all the trouble, and this information was accordingly conveyed by us to b. 

few minutes later, we get a notification from the magic pin app that our order has been cancelled and our money has now been fully refunded. frustrated and hungry, we call up b to understand what's going on and he tells us that he has already picked up the order (and the 50rs. promised for the extra kms), and is on his way to deliver it to our location (according to him, in his own words, he has picked it up from the restaurant, so restaurant can't do anything now, neither can he, because he has the food in his hand, so he told us not to bother about what magic pin has done). 

another 20 minutes go by and b is at our doorstep with the order. he told my husband that magic pin does cancel out orders at times when the delivery time takes too long (in this case, being assigned from a to b and all the extra distance confusion and such), or something of that sort. he casually asked my husband the price of the order and he blurted out that it was about 1k. just before leaving our doorstep, b casually added, there are chances magic pin might try to take a ""penalty from him for late/delayed delivery"". so this is where we realised how the whole game's now gonna enfold. immediately, i warned my husband that in a few days time, b, even though he had portrayed himself as the nice guy and delivered our order post cancellation, take  he's now gonna target us for that 1k my husband accidentally blurted out.

true to my words, b contacted my husband from another number today (my husband had blocked the original number out of fear of being annoyed by this guy in future), claiming magic pin has fined him for 900 bucks and he would like that money from us. we have no problem with the money part, we don't believe in having anything for free, but as long as it's not being paid to the platform or the restaurant (both of which have not approached us), we don't feel comfortable with b saying his penalty is for 900 rupees. we don't support lying or cheating, and we do know his penalty can't be as expensive as our order.

what should we do in this situation, as even if we block him, he could come up to our house and threaten us (true we have security and our society uses mygate for entries and exits, but he could enter the society under the pretext of delivering an order in some other apartment). has anyone ever faced something like this through magic pin?"

why do our people keep doing this? isn’t it disrespectful to our gods to have their images left on a roadside like this? it’s dusty, exposed, and bound to cause unnecessary problems.

why don’t the authorities stop this before it becomes a full-blown issue? there must be better ways to show devotion that don’t involve creating safety risks or complicating urban planning. what are your thoughts?"
reddit,2025-02-11 20:47:18,"khumbmela experience hi guys, i am sharing my experience during my recent trip to prayagraj and varanasi. as expected it was crowded and chaotic but definitely one of a kind of experience. we were four people, three of us started from hyderabad and one joined from delhi. over 3 days we visited prayagraj and varanasi. we had limited time with us so we just sticked to the main parts. as i have read and saw, one would need atleast 3-4 days in prayagraj to fully witness all the things. but not everyone has that luxury of time, so let's start with my experience.

note: make sure you carry sufficient cash as not all places have the digital pay option and be very cautious of your belongings. expect slow moving vehicles and be prepared to walk for kms.

day 1 feb 7th: hyderabad -&gt; lucknow ✈️ &amp; lucknow -&gt; prayagraj 💺
1. we reached to lucknow by flight first and took a metro to alambagh bus stand. metro is affordable, it costed 20/- per person. we were here by 11 am.
2. after reaching the bus stand, i went to ac booking counter and took a shatabdi bus, fare was around 390 /- per person. the destination was supposed to be civil lines bus stand in prayagraj.
3. but due to dynamic traffic restrictions i suppose our bus was halted at bela kachar bus stand. we reached here by 5 pm in the evening
4. from here we have shuttle buses to sangam area but they do not take us to the sangam, they stopped some where middle of the route to the sangam. these electric powered buses were highly crowded and ac was turned off at some point but due to passengers raising their voice they turned it back. it was the most frustrating 1 hour on the bus in my whole trip. i don't know what were the alternatives from that bus stand.
5. we walked for a while and caught a e-rickshaw to the sangam area, first he said he will drop us at nagvasuki temple but after paying extra, he dropped somewhere near to the bade hanuman temple. from there i guess it was 2-3 km walk i suppose. i guess we were at the starting point of sangam by 7:30 in the evening due to high traffic and thus slow moving vehicles. once you reach at the sangam area you could ask around for the ghat directions and it should be easy to follow, get ready to walk or pay some bikers who were charging around 200/- per person to drop at the ghat. khumb mela sure did brought a lot of business ideas :smile:
6. we had some light food as it was getting late already and then took holy dip in the sangam ghat.
7. after that we went to bade hanuman temple but they did not allow us inside the temple as it was late, i think around 10pm. so we did virtual darshan from the screens they arranged and started back to the room i booked on airbnb. it was near new bairahana petrol bunk. i booked here because i thought it was in the middle of civil lines and sangam area. we had to walk until main road as no autos were available. from main road we took an auto and reached our home stay. home owner was helpful.

day 2 feb 8th: prayagraj -&gt; varanasi 🚆
1. we first visited alopi bagh shakti peeth temple, which was near by from our place. we walked in 30 minutes. the temple was very lightly crowded so the darshan took less than 40 minutes.
2. we had some breakfast on the way back and prepared to start for varanasi.
3. luckily we had a vandebharat train available with seats, so booked them quickly and started to prayagraj junction. please reach to this station quickly as they are redirecting people from one gate to another. our train was on platform 6 some where far from where auto dropped us.
4. in couple of hours we reached to varanasi junction. from what i have understood banaras station is the one where we should drop off to visit the kasi viswanath temple. we first tried for some dormitories but they were all booked, so again booked an airbnb in mahmoorganj area. it was a little far from the temple but the rooms were a little more affordable. we reached here by auto which costed 250/-
5. we took some rest and started to the ghat first for evening harthi. because this was new place to us, we could not reach in time. harthi happens at all ghats i guess but dasashwmedh ghat is famous. we then decided to visit the kasi temple first but then stunned by the queue lines that were kilometers long. here we would be approached by multiple people who were saying they will help us with quick darshan for a cost of 1k per person. my mother had a number of a guy who charged 550/- per person and took us to towards gate number 2 of the temple. i personally did not like this at all as he will first take us to a shop where we had to buy parshad again costing money. they demanded every one of us have to buy the parshad but we argued and bought for 2 people. then this broker guy simply asked us to join the line some how cutting in the middle and as you would people standing back to us where not happy at all and even complained to the police standing nearby. all the police standing knew this business but still pushed us to the back. some how we entered the line after some struggle. get ready for this kind of experience when some body approaches you for ""quick darshan"" it took around 2-3 hours, so i suppose it is worth it as the free or normal darshan line was very huge. we came out around 9:30 or 10 pm in the night and visted vishalakshi temple which is near by. road to annapurna devi mandir was closed and we were told by some people that this temple can be visited only if we stand in the mainline, i don't know what is the gate number for the mainline as there were multiple ways to enter in to the temple.
6. we had some dinner nearby and started back to the homestay.

day 3 feb 9th: varanasi
1. we started around 9 am from room and had some breakfast and started for the kaala bhairav temple by auto. note that even when you catch auto you will not be dropped before the temple anywhere in varanasi. you either need to walk for 1-2 kms or catch cycle rickshaws which are charged 50-100 per person.
2. after 2 hours in the line (we cut the lines some times) we completed the darshan and started towards dashaswamedh ghat for pind pradhan, here you would need to negotiate for prices again. we paid 2100 *2 for two pind pradhan rituals.
3. then we took a group boat which costed 100 per person. there are private boats as well, but you need to negotiate the prices as they are just unreasonable prices quoted by these boat people.
4. we did some local shopping and noticed people were already sitting on the chairs available on the ghat by 1 or 2 pm. we did not know what these were at first but by evening i got to know they were seated for the evening harthi. we did not find a place at all to sit and watch and paid 300/- per person to be seated at the top of nearby houses. they said these were local standard rates. i was amazed by how the local people were creating businesses for themselves, they earn 5x or 10x my salary easily.
5. we had a decent view at harthi and it was really mesmerizing. i did not expect it to be that good but the huge crowd and chanting or singing songs all at once added to this other worldly experience.
6. harti started around 6:30 in the evening and continued for 40-50 minutes i guess.
7. we then had some dinner and tried some local street foods and went back to the room. 

this was the end of the journey for us as we had an afternoon flight from varanasi to hyderabad in the next day. although it was struggle at times reaching the destination, but once we arrived we forgot all those things and enjoyed the chaotic atmosphere. i saw people from various parts of the country and even from outside of our country and of all ages. be it kids carried by their parents or the elderly people who still want to experience this moment again even in their final stages of the life just adds that motivation that we can do it too. have a safe trip to khumb mela"

reddit,2025-02-13 11:39:52,"rubble trouble: dumping around rubble is so common. what can be done? wherever there’s abandoned construction rubble or neglected corners in the city, it’s inevitably become garbage dumping sites. it’s as if the presence of rubble invites people to throw more waste there.
as a stand up comedian once put it- “it looks like the aesthetic style is post-apocalyptic chic”.
the interesting part is that the moment the rubble is removed, the dumping stops, and the space becomes cleaner. the issue is that it rarely happens and even the municipality is responsible for leaving extra construction material like paver tiles, pipes etc at the work site. (example - 100ft road indiranagar)
so, my question is - does anyone know of any organizations or initiatives that handle this at scale? are there any models from other cities that have worked in tackling this issue?
there’s construction happening at every corner of the city and people lack basic civic sense. municipality workers pick the waste but this isn’t the long term solution since the rubble keeps getting generated in different areas.

reddit,2025-02-13 13:05:19,"more to orr traffic &amp; blr- rant/opinion it might be long so feel free to skim through.

# about traffic

i usually take the bus—not that it’s great but i'd rather have mental peace than the stress of driving in blr. the point is, when i took my scooter to work today, not only did i have a horrible start to the day but i felt so bad for people **driving their own vehicles** to work in that route (daily). the roads are a mess-the potholes, the dust, the poorly planned underpasses and the illegal encroachment. everything is so so chaotic and people are still fighting traffic &amp; time- riding on footpaths, shatters from construction work, over rocks and debris to get to office in time. it’s literally to go and work!

# lifestyle and downgrade

how low have our standards fallen? it makes me furious and also **sad** that we pay so much in taxes yet endure a subpar lifestyle. karnataka has the highest rto tax, and this is what we get. people working 8-9 hours a day, commuting for 3 hours, and sleeping &lt; 8 hours are made to believe they’re hustling—when in reality, it's an unhealthy lifestyle that's been glorified. issues like cardiac arrest, hair loss, and diabetes can easily be traced back to this. we’re heading in the wrong direction.

# improving traffic

on top of it all, the bus and metro fare hike? it's baffling! while we know there are obvious solutions to improving traffic like wfh, wider roads, faster work, better planning etc, the no-brainer, win-win solution is to improve **public transport.** yes, public transport can single-handedly improve traffic in this city. metro will take time to see widespread usage but bmtc buses are an immediate available solution.

# further on bmtc busses to improve traffic

there's a vajra (ac) bus **500-ca** which runs between banashankari &lt;&gt; itpl via jayanagar, btm, silk board, hsr bda, agara, bellandur, kadubeesanahalli, mahadevapura and so on. it covers a good chunk of dense residential and workplace hubs. they also run every 5-10 mins i think. then what's the problem? that is **not enough.** the seats are filled as it leaves banashankari (which is good) but even by the time it reaches btm or silk board, it's packed to the brim- leaving hardly any room to stand. commuters board with frustration and disappointment knowing they have another 1-1.5 hours of travel ahead without **space to stand**!

increasing the frequency of these buses will easily attract more footfall- especially on this route where people have the affluence to pay for comfort (ac) and convenience. it may be difficult to tackle in other locations but the orr and sarjapur road- where most companies are located—should be a straightforward, revenue-friendly, and eco-conscious solution.

# koramangala to sarjapur road

this road is supposed to be better than orr, yet no one talks about how bad it really is. from st. john's to jakkasandra, it's mostly decent—wide roads with only a few potholes and construction debris. but that doesn’t mean it gets a free pass forever. two nearly invisible speed breakers—one at st. francis and another near the water tank—are accidents waiting to happen. in daylight, they’re hard to spot; at night, they’re practically invisible. i’ve seen countless close calls, and once, the auto i was in got rear-ended by a thar because the driver **couldn’t see the speed bump**!

beyond jakkasandra, the situation gets worse—potholes, half-finished construction, and dust so thick it single-handedly lowers the aqi. the road starts wide but keeps narrowing—a highway at the start, a goat path by the time you reach agara. from agara to sarjapur signal, it's downright dreadful. the service road beside the flyover barely has space for a single car at a time. what were they even thinking when they built this? these are some of the busiest roads in the city, yet they’re built like an afterthought. kudos to development!

# conclusion tl;dr- a disheartening realisation

i’m just very sad today. i usually steer clear of these but today has been a sinking mix of frustration, disappointment and helplessness. blaming the city, the departments, the government, the bosses, their bosses, the companies and so on. i relate to ambi from the movie anniyan/aparichit. we thought he was a loser but today we’re all taking the l’s. if anyone reading this has the knowledge, sources and resources to fight for the bare minimums, you will have the support of millions of taxpayers in blr.

goodnight!"

-------

a couple of months ago, i had an interesting conversation with my uncle. he was praising the government left and right because of how the vande bharat trains are changing the face of the indian railways by bringing in world-class, if not beyond world-class, level of travel to india. 

***'aur kya chahiye? look at the development!'***

fast forward to the present, he and the rest of my privileged family are engaged in a conversation spewing vitriol, and classist &amp; casteist rage at the people vandalizing the trains in north india. labels such as 'uncivilized', 'gawaars', 'chapri', and more are freely being plastered on these people. it is happening in social media too. videos of overcrowded compartments and passengers storming into reserved coaches have become viral with most of the privileged section of our society seeing this as nothing more than the unruly behavior of uncivilized villagers. there are even questions about our taxes being wasted on the rpf and grp and whatnot letting our country 'descend into lawlessness.'

let us step back for a moment and look at this situation from a different perspective. these privileged people venting out their frustration with the overcrowded trains is not unfounded, but the way they are doing it reveals a deeper layer of their psyche. instead of holding the government responsible [for cutting general and sleeper coaches](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/railways-indian-railways-goes-premium-with-more-ac-coaches-per-train-key-details-inside-3417508/) while prioritizing 'world-class' premium services like vande bharat trains, they direct their rage at [people who have no options.](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/soaring-train-fares-shrinking-sleeper-coaches-add-to-passenger-woes/article67545165.ece) the outrage isn't just about the congestion. it is about having to share a space with people they think don't belong there.

my relatives, especially that uncle, who rarely travels by train have the audacity to talk about second-hand embarrassment over these incidents, all while keeping mum on [the policies that created this situation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/indian-railways-on-the-wrong-track-darjeeling-train-accident-balasore-triple-tragedy-passenger-safety-kavach/article68362231.ece). the same bhakts whining about the 'lawlessness' now, never once spoke about the reduction of the general coaches, [the lack of safety](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/analysis-rail-safety-off-track-as-train-incidents-surge-6793663), [the fucking selfie booths of our baby](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-spent-162-cr-on-pms-3d-selfie-photo-booths-across-50-railway-stations-says-rti-reply/article67676762.ece). they remained silent while the ticket prices shot up and the people who can barely afford it are not even ensured basic dignity.

this outrage about 'lawlessness' and lack of safety never was a point of concern when sanghi mobs, backed by the state, [were attacking people in broad daylight](https://scroll.in/article/1062772/they-saw-a-muslim-name-and-attacked-how-hindutva-mobs-ran-amok-on-mira-road), [lynching people](https://www.thehindu.com/specials/text-and-context/states-lax-response-to-lynching/article67138604.ece), [enforcing caste hierarchy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/up-rajasthan-mp-top-in-cases-of-atrocities-on-dalits-report/article68670887.ece) and [violence through religious terror](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-58406194). the only time they suddenly become aware of 'law and order' is when the same people who were handed impunity by the government, to do whatever they want began disrupting their own comfort. when these same groups go about [attacking interfaith couples](https://cjp.org.in/2024-love-jihad-as-a-socio-political-tool-caste-endogamy-and-hindutvas-dominance-over-gender-and-social-boundaries-in-india/l), [spreading terror in the name of culture and religion](https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/rising-tide-of-atrocities-against-dalits-2850523), and more, they do not cry for 'civic sense.' but when these people start breaking rules in their spaces, whether it is ac trains, malls, or gated communities, then it suddenly becomes a problem. like their pawpaw says, 'hypocrisy ki bhi seema hoti hain.'

the government's obsession with vande bharat and the bullet train shows how messed up their priorities are. these trains are turned into an event with the prime baby of our country being hyped up so much as if he himself built these trains with his own hands. when incidents like these happen, the news media will be silent and these bhakts will say 'you expect him to take care of everything?' these idiots don't realize that the government is doing nothing to solve the problems of the majority of the population. these lodus have spent more than a decade excusing and even justifying policies that strip the underprivileged of basic dignity. failures of the state are treated as 'minor inconveniences' while blaming those most affected by them or demonizing oppressed communities. the state of despair we are in is because when they had to demand accountability, they chose to defend the people in power. it is easy to shit on the desperation of the poor on social media from the comfort of your home, but it takes willful ignorance to turn a blind eye to the people who put them in that situation.

to clarify, i am not saying that the vandalism by the people attacking the trains is justified, but i feel they are not doing this *only* out of unruliness, but also because the system has given them no choice. general coaches are packed to the brim, trains are running hours behind schedule, and sanitation is non-existent, but ***'woh dekho! bullet train.'***

unsurprisingly, both groups (the ones whining about uncivilized people, and the ones engaging in vandalism), remain among the government's most loyal supporters. they tirelessly make excuses, spread disinformation, defend the government's blatant anti-poor policies, etc. both groups have been convinced that 'something good is happening somewhere. it may not be happening to or around me, but it is happening.' my neighbor, who was in tears when the hindus in bangladesh were being attacked and killed, is silent about his hindu brothers and sisters in the kumbh mela. he is silent about the government quietly brushing that and the delhi station stampede under the rug.

the state has provided both these groups with plenty of enemies — minorities, oppressed communities, intellectuals, or anyone who questions the government. the politicians have successfully created an environment of 'us vs them' while they happily fill their coffers and give themselves and their families and friends a grand life."
reddit,2025-02-17 15:20:07,"india doesn’t care about its people. it never did. another tragedy, another display of government negligence, another reminder that this country’s priorities are completely fucked. this time, it’s the stampede at a delhi railway station, people crushed to death because of overcrowding, mismanagement, and a total lack of basic safety measures. just another day in a nation that treats its citizens like disposable garbage.

but where is the outrage? where is the accountability? nowhere. because our rulers don’t give a damn about human lives. their concern lies elsewhere, censoring comedians, banning films, moral policing women, and throwing tantrums over stand-up jokes. while bodies pile up in railway stations and women fight for basic dignity, the indian government is busy cracking down on comedians like samay raina, as if laughter is the real threat to this nation.

let’s be clear: india has never cared about its people, especially its women, dalits, muslims, and the poor. it has only ever cared about control, who gets to speak, who gets to exist, and who gets crushed under the weight of a system built to serve the privileged few. the recent court ruling on marital rape proves this once again: a woman’s body is still not her own. if her husband rapes her, it’s not a crime, it’s just marriage. that’s the level of barbarity we’re dealing with.

this country is rotting from within. public infrastructure is crumbling, trains and stations are death traps, healthcare is a joke, but what does the government focus on? controlling what people wear, eat, watch, and say. dissenting voices are silenced while rapists and murderers walk free. a politician’s son can run over a girl and nothing happens. a comedian cracks a joke, and the state machinery mobilizes like he’s a terrorist. that’s india’s idea of justice.

and let’s not forget the spineless masses who enable this circus. the moral police who cry about culture while ignoring the everyday horrors of this country. the pick-me women who defend a system that oppresses them. the so-called patriots who scream ‘vande mataram’ while their government steals their dignity, their rights, and even their lives. the media, the judiciary, the politicians, every institution is complicit in this grand con of keeping people blind and obedient.

this is not a functioning country. it’s a dystopian nightmare masquerading as a democracy. people are dying in stampedes because of government neglect, women are raped with impunity, minorities are terrorized, and yet our leaders are busy hunting comedians and policing instagram reels. if that doesn’t make your blood boil, you’re either privileged enough to ignore it or brainwashed enough to justify it.

so no, i won’t ‘respect’ this system. i won’t pretend everything is fine. and if calling this out makes you uncomfortable, good. maybe it’s time you stopped making excuses for a nation that fails its people every single day."

i believe this country and where it is headed right now is a complete and utter joke. hear me out! i have some points which makes me say that. 

1. to start of, something everyone knows at this point which is how we media and politicians are ignoring the actual rape cases and pushing comedians for no reason. making freedom of speech a big joke.
2. we have pm who does not do press conferences, he was forced to one recently in us along side trump and kind of humiliated the whole country, if you dont know. you probably dont know because media was focused on ""would you rather.."" question.
3. the economy is a joke, apart from the value against the dollar. there is literally no jobs any where, well it's a global thing right not just india? but they dont have around 1 million student attempting to give entrance exam (jee) to be become almighty engineer. they actually have different jobs and their parents realise may be that it's not binary (not just enginner or doctor).
4. the police, again the latent thing, they are more focused on that then rapes and what not. i literally see so many gundas on the internet in any occasion possible, the recent one would be couples getting beaten on valentines day  on camera (literally). and that is somehow not concerning?
5. the taxes? come on, apart from the recent relief after getting robbed till now, and i am not sure how good it is. but do we really see the output of the tax we pay..like is it a good roi ? for example germans pay a lot of taxes and you realize why because they have free edu. good roads and what not. also, only the ones doing job pay the taxes, any business man i know locally does not, even though they earn a lot more.
6. the old generation kind of dont see the problem it seems. it's all about culture and what not, cant marry outside your cast, etc. etc. 
7. should i even talk about aqi? it's a smoke and i have never seen pm or the ruling party as much as comment on it, the concern is too much to ask for you know, priorities. 
8. and there is so much more just am i the only one who realize this? or am i worrying too much? it's just does not feel right where we are headed with this. 

  
tldr: you have to read the whole thing cos i feel its too important to summarize in short."
reddit,2025-02-21 01:26:08,"i want to leave india. and when i say i want to, people start protesting ""you hate your country haww, so you are just wasting our resources?"" bitch i pay for them

you want to know why i want to leave? you want to act like questioning the state of things makes me some kind of traitor? fine. let's go step by step because apparently, blind patriotism is easier than confronting reality.

let’s start with the latest outrage—the supreme court telling ranveer allahbadia that his jokes would ""make women feel ashamed."" oh, so now we care about women’s dignity? when it’s about a guy cracking jokes, suddenly the system wants to step in and be the moral police. but when it’s about something that actually matters—marital rape? silence. absolute, deafening silence. you know what’s legal here? a man forcing himself on his wife, because apparently, marriage is a free pass for assault. but sure, let’s focus on jokes. let’s spend our time on the big issues like comedy instead of, i don’t know, the fact that rapists walk free, that women have to beg for justice, that survivors are shamed while criminals get sympathy.

and since we’re talking about priorities, let’s talk about law and order in general. every week, a new case of some rich, powerful guy committing a crime and getting away with it. drunk drivers mowing down people? political connections will fix it. a celebrity gets caught doing something illegal? don’t worry, a pr campaign will clear their image. a regular person, though? get ready to rot in the system. there’s no justice here—just a game where the rich and connected win, and the rest of us pretend we live in a functioning democracy.

but let’s not stop there. let’s talk about the culture—because this country prides itself on being “progressive” while clinging to ideas that should’ve died centuries ago. ever since this ranveer allahbadia controversy, it’s been clearer than ever that we’re not moving forward—we’re stuck. our definition of progress is adding more shopping malls while keeping the same regressive mindsets alive. women still get judged for what they wear. inter-caste or interfaith couples still get harassed. parents still control their kids like they own them, shoving them into careers they hate because “log kya kahenge” (what will people say). and god forbid you question tradition—because the moment you do, you're suddenly disrespecting ""bharatiya sanskriti"" (indian culture).

let’s move on to infrastructure, or rather, the lack of it. my parents pay their taxes, but where does that money go? because it’s sure as hell not going into roads. i don’t even live in some remote village—i live in a developed town. but apparently, ""developed"" means nothing, because the nearest mcdonald's is 17 kilometers away. and sure, it’s not about mcdonald's itself—it’s about how basic infrastructure is still a joke. potholes, traffic that moves slower than a dying snail, and an internet speed that makes you question if you’re still in 2025 or if you time-traveled back to 2008.

and then there’s education. a system that rewards memorization over intelligence. a system where creativity is crushed and students are pushed into engineering or medicine like cattle, with no regard for what they actually want. you’re not taught to think—you’re taught to obey. schools don’t prepare you for life; they prepare you to be a replaceable cog in an overpopulated machine. and if you dare to dream outside the conventional path? good luck explaining that to your family, because in their eyes, success is a government job or an iit degree.

then we have the economy. oh, you want to build wealth? well, good luck, because if you're not born into it, you're in for a lifelong struggle. wages are low, the cost of living is rising, and everything is taxed to death. want to start a business? get ready to drown in bureaucratic nonsense and corruption. want to invest? hope you enjoy government policies changing overnight, killing industries with zero warning. and if you somehow manage to make money, guess what? you’re still at the mercy of outdated financial policies and a stock market that swings like a drunk pendulum.

and finally, the biggest hypocrisy of all—if i want to leave, suddenly i’m the villain? suddenly, i “hate my country”? no. i don’t hate my country—i hate what it has become. i hate that questioning these things makes people defensive instead of introspective. i hate that people refuse to acknowledge reality because it’s easier to pretend everything is fine. i hate that i have to explain why wanting a better life isn’t a betrayal.

but sure, keep calling me ungrateful. keep telling me that ""no country is perfect,"" as if that excuses everything. keep pretending that patriotism means blind obedience instead of demanding better. and while you do that, i’ll be making my way to a place that values progress over empty pride."

half my orders are missing items, and they just mark them as ""returned"" without telling me. no refund, no explanation. just gone.

• non-existent inventory: forget anything remotely fancy. even basic stuff like capsicum and brinjal are constantly out of stock. what's the point of an online grocery service if you can't even get the basics?

people have literally pooped in the changing compartments. i was super disgusted with the experience i had to face there. i just wanted to get out of that place, i couldn’t focus on praying which was the whole purpose of the visit. 
and now i have no shame in saying we indians lack basic etiquettes, decency and hygiene."

reddit,2025-02-27 16:51:31,"middle-class taxpayers in india get nothing – struggling with my mom’s cancer treatment at aiims i never thought i’d be in this position—running around hospitals, waiting in endless queues, dealing with rude staff, and watching my mom suffer, all while feeling completely helpless. but here we are.

my mom has breast cancer, and after 40 exhausting days of waitings and follow ups, she finally got her first chemo at aiims. but this is just the beginning. we still have at least six more chemo cycles, one major surgery, one full course of radiation, and countless follow-ups ahead. i don’t know how we’ll survive this.

💔 the reality of being middle class in india

we are a middle-class family in odisha. my father is a government employee with a limited income, and we never thought we’d be in a situation like this.

the bsky card (biju swasthya kalyan yojana) provides ₹5-7 lakh per year for non-taxpayers, allowing them to get private hospital treatment. meanwhile, we, the taxpayers, are left to rot in government hospitals where:
✔️ appointments take months.
✔️ security guards and hospital staff treat you like garbage.
✔️ you’re just another number in a never-ending queue.

i see people getting faster, better treatment at private hospitals with their bsky cards, while we—who contribute to the system—are stuck navigating a nightmare of bureaucracy, exhaustion, and inhumane treatment.

the doctors at aiims are great, but reaching them is a battle. i feel like i spend more time standing in lines, begging for updates, and filling out paperwork than actually taking care of my mom.

🩺 the aiims treatment nightmare

the experience at aiims has been nothing short of exhausting. the process is painfully slow, and the system is broken. patients who are already weak from their illness have to wait hours just to get basic procedures done. appointments take weeks, sometimes months. there’s no proper communication, and it feels like no one cares about the suffering of patients or their families.

the worst part is the inhuman behavior of the security and hospital staff. they talk to people as if they are objects, shouting at patients, pushing them aside, and treating caregivers like a burden. i’ve seen elderly patients, some too weak to stand, being forced to wait in lines for hours while hospital staff act as if they don’t exist.

we are exhausted—mentally, physically, and emotionally. instead of focusing on supporting my mom through this painful treatment, most of my energy is spent navigating a system that is designed to make things harder.

💰 looking for any possible financial help

each chemo cycle costs ₹1.3 lakh, and we still have six more cycles, one major surgery, one full radiation course, and countless follow-ups ahead.

i am looking for any possible financial help:
	•	are there any ngos, government schemes, or organizations that provide financial assistance for breast cancer treatment?
	•	can i enroll in any health insurance now, even with a pre-existing condition?


🙏 my mom is suffering, and i feel helpless

her chemo side effects are horrible:
	•	severe diarrhea – she can barely keep anything down.
	•	zero taste – everything tastes like nothing, and she doesn’t want to eat.
	•	extreme weakness – she barely has the strength to move.

and this is just the first chemo cycle. we still have six more chemo cycles, one major surgery, one full radiation course, and countless follow-ups ahead.

i don’t know how to make this any easier for her. watching her suffer while feeling completely powerless is the worst feeling in the world.

💔 we pay taxes all our lives, but when we need help, we are left to suffer. where is the justice in this?

any advice, guidance, or any source of financial help just words of encouragement would mean the world to me right now. thank you for reading."

reddit,2025-03-01 08:59:48,"stray cattle are causing road accidents 
stray cattle on roads are becoming a serious problem across india, but no one seems to be addressing it properly. i want to know—is this happening in your city too?

in kanpur, the situation is getting worse:
   
accidents &amp; fatalities

a 17-year-old was killed in november 2023 after his bike crashed into two bulls fighting on the road.

another man suffered serious injuries near p. road after hitting a cow at night.

stray cattle are commonly found blocking roads in vegetable markets, busy intersections, and narrow streets, making driving extremely dangerous.


  
      corruption &amp; ineffective measures

the cattle catching abhiyaan exists, but it barely works. locals claim that municipal officials often ignore complaints unless there’s some personal benefit involved.

most stray cows are only caught when suspected of being smuggled for slaughter, but nothing is done about those causing road accidents.

owners let their cows roam during the day and bring them back at night for milking, making it hard for authorities to take action.


    abandoned male calves (a growing issue)

since male calves don’t produce milk and cannot be slaughtered, they are often abandoned.

a friend and i once found a weak, abandoned male calf in our society. we named him nandi and took care of him—but most are left to die.


 is this happening where you live too?

have you or someone you know been in an accident due to stray cattle?

are there any government efforts in your city to solve this issue?

how do we push for actual accountability?


would love to hear your thoughts!"

reddit,2025-03-01 23:24:54,"dont join a maruti dealership worst career decision of my life incentives worth 1 lakh on hold hey everyone, i worked in the sales department of a car dealership, and if any fresher is looking to join a dealership, especially maruti, i want to share my experience.

i worked in one of the dealerships for almost a year as a trainer. my key job roles were training people about cars, teaching them how to pitch a product, ensuring they performed well, and conducting interviews with new joinees in both sales and service. since i had an automobile background, i got this job. the pay was okay for a fresher—₹15,000—while many others joined for as little as ₹8,000 or even less (below minimum wage  ). which is illegal even in service centers, we would hire people at the lowest possible salary, by asking personal questions like how many family members they had. most of these employees came from economically unstable backgrounds, making them easy to manipulate and force into work without proper adherence to labor laws. 

they never started my pf even after six months, nor did i receive esi or health benefits. this was the case for almost all my colleagues across different dealerships. in this region there are 5-5 prominent dealerships   
i even being a civil engineer over saw the construction of 2 workshops for zero extra pay and the owners got a very cheap labor out of me who would do everything they told me to do   
i did almost everything they needed in a dealership and even more 

# salary deductions &amp; unfair work conditions

if an employee was late—even by just 30 minutes—three times in a month, a whole day’s salary would be deducted, which is illegal. there was no pay for overtime either. but it was expected to stay till 8 pm 

due to a shortage of drivers, new sales guys were never treated with respect and were often expected to take customers on test drives themselves or wait till the seniors got the test drive . test drives would sometimes result in successful deals, but other times, we’d return empty-handed, hand over the keys to security at 9 pm, and then take the bus home. i have driven evaluated and given service advice to so many customers ive lost count 

during peak season, i personally delivered multiple cars to customers. i never took a single tip, but every time a customer offered ₹200 or so, i felt humiliated—like i had been reduced to that level.

# unpaid incentives &amp; pressure from management

every trainer had an incentive that varied between ₹35 to ₹70 per car, but i never saw a single penny of it. 

assuming a dealerships sells around 100 cars which they easily would i have around 35000 thousand in incentives stuck here but the actual numbers are a lot higher   
then maruti contests which i won twice but they are just delaying the funds stating useless reason

if new employees didn’t make a sale, i was the one questioned—management constantly asked what i was teaching. the system is designed in such a way that we are held liable for everything, even things beyond our control.

we were also forced to sell many vehicles with changed panels and body parts, lying to customers on a daily basis. after a while, this kind of dishonesty eats away at you mentally.

i would accompany a new joining  batch of 4-5 people every day, walking long distances to help them get test drives and land sales. many times, i succeeded, but the backlash for missing targets was insane.

safety was never a consideration. if a car had multiple test drives in a day, we had to drive like maniacs to finish the target and return the vehicle on time. lunch breaks were non-existent, and if we weren’t out chasing leads, we were sitting in one place, making hundreds of calls, surrounded by mosquitoes—working conditions that aren’t even remotely humane.

# maruti’s role in all this

compared to other brands, maruti suzuki (msil) succeeds because of how power-tripping pusshy  and abusive their regional and national sales teams are. they have a target of 3,000–4,000 cars per region and make sure dealerships hit those numbers by scolding employees, instructing hr to withhold salaries, and interrogating staff as if they own them. but when it comes to fulfilling their own promises—like paying incentives worth thousands—they turn a deaf ear.

maruti is fully aware of these exploitative practices, yet they allow them to continue because, at the end of the day, all they care about is sales. the same applies to other brands—every company operates with this mentality.

at maruti, there are countless unnecessary tasks to complete every month. the ilearn app, which barely works, wastes salespeople’s time, as they are forced to answer questions they struggle with due to a lack of tech familiarity. then there’s the car configurator, ms chatbox, and the endless sms and emails customers keep getting.

on top of this, we had to roam the city all day, visiting shops, trying to get leads from banks, and meeting monthly enquiry targets. many days, we wouldn’t even have a drop of water to drink or money to buy something refreshing. the exhaustion from walking, traveling on crowded buses and local trains, and dealing with rejection was brutal.

then comes the worst part: incentives were never cleared.

* a good salesperson selling 3-4 cars a month was eligible for several incentives:
   * spot incentive (₹1,000–₹2,000 per car upon delivery)
   * target completion incentives (₹3,000–₹4,000)
   * accessories incentive (₹500–₹1,000)
   * loan payout (1%, but another 1% was kept by the dealer)
   * add-on incentives (extended warranty, rsa, ccp)
   * maruti contest incentives (extra payouts for top sales performers in each of maruti’s 16 regions) around 5000 -10000 thousand

however, these incentives were rarely paid. the reason? if employees received their rightful earnings, they would leave for better opportunities. keeping them unpaid trapped high-performing staff, forcing them to take a financial loss before quitting.  
we never had sick leaves it was all adjusted from working extra

# ethical issues in sales

sales staff were pressured to sell cars at any cost, even pushing customers into unaffordable loans. we saw many cases where a buyer couldn’t pay their emis, yet we had to get them a loan—usually taxi drivers. when they defaulted, bank representatives would interrogate us. but when we faced issues like software failures, withheld incentives, or unfair terminations, maruti would claim, “we don’t interfere in dealer-employee matters.”

yet, they had no problem instructing hr to hold our salaries, forcing us to attend useless meetings and training, and making us push terrible-value cars onto customers—cars that weren’t even available, like the s-presso. we had to deal with customers’ anger and sometimes even threats because of this.

# toxic work culture

unlike hyundai and tata, where sales staff are treated with at least some respect (even if they work less), maruti is full of backstabbers. many times, we gave constructive criticism, only for the maruti regional team to steal our ideas, claim them as their own, and receive awards for them—while we got nothing, not even the legal bare minimum.

there’s no real growth in this industry.

* you start as a salesperson.
* if you’re lucky, you become a team leader.
* then maybe a manager.
* if fortune smiles on you, you become a business head, earning around ₹60,000 a month—by the time you’re 50.

# no job security &amp; no future

in the service department, it’s the same story.  
no company will hire you because you don’t have a proper offer letter or salary slip. everything is paid in cash. your experience holds no value. very few people manage to escape dealerships and get jobs in proper companies or government roles where at least health insurance is provided.

organizations like fada, siam, and the parent companies don’t care one bit.

# worker exploitation &amp; health hazards

thousands of employees are forced to lie to customers, upsell products they can’t afford, and work without fair wages.

service staff work in unsafe conditions, with no protective equipment. they breathe toxic fumes and handle carcinogens daily.

# the sad reality

i want things to be better for these workers, but my words can’t reach the right people or make a difference. these businessmen will squeeze every last penny from us until there’s nothing left to take."

reddit,2025-03-04 20:36:27,"india’s local governance is a mess. here’s how we can fix it i’ve been thinking a lot about how unnecessarily complicated india’s governance structure is. we have districts, tehsils, blocks, mandals, panchayats, municipalities, and municipal corporations, all overlapping and creating a bureaucratic nightmare. who is responsible for what? no one knows. this system was created from colonial times, and it needs to be reformed

**the problem**

* a district has its own commissioner, medical officer, fire service, etc. but at the same time, multiple districts can overlap with a municipality.
* rural areas are even worse – a single village has to deal with a gram panchayat, a block officer, a tehsil officer, and the district administration, all at the same time.
* big cities are just as bad. eg: the bmc in mumbai handles roads and waste, the state government controls transport and policing, and district officers manage revenue. too many departments, zero accountability.

**the solution: a simple, three-tier system-**

instead of having so many overlapping layers, why not just have three clear levels?

1. central government – handles national issues like defense, foreign policy, taxation, and inter-state matters.
2. state government – responsible for state policing, healthcare, education, and state-level infrastructure.
3. local government-

a) municipal corporations (big cities) – fully autonomous, handling transport, housing, waste, water, policing, and taxation.

b) municipalities (small towns) – similar to municipal corporations but on a smaller scale.

c) district governments (for rural areas) – one elected district government replaces blocks, tehsils, and panchayats, handling healthcare, schools, roads, sanitation, and economic development.

**funding for local governments-**

one of the biggest problems in india is that local governments don’t have financial independence. they rely on states for funding. that's why there a should a new finance bill that states the following:

1. 10% of the central government’s gross tax revenue should go as devolution to local governments.
2. 35% of the central government’s gross tax revenue should go as devolution to state governments.
3. 25% of a state’s own tax revenue should go as devolution to local governments within that state.

this would ensure that local governments have guaranteed funding and won't have to rely on the state or center for grants. this would also give the local governments financial autonomy

**outcomes-**

1. more accountability – if something isn’t working in your city or district, you know exactly who is responsible.
2. less corruption &amp; wastage – removing unnecessary layers will save billions of rupees every year.
3. faster decision-making – no more endless approvals from multiple departments.
4. better local services – cities and districts get direct funding, improving governance.

**how can this be implemented-**

1. pilot projects in 1-2 states – merge tehsils, blocks, and panchayats into district governments and see how it works.
2. amend the constitution – modify 73rd &amp; 74th amendments to officially restructure local governance.
3. expand nationwide in phases – implement it gradually over 5-10 years.

**note-**

most countries don’t have this many administrative layers. this confusing system in india only creates inefficiency, confusion, and corruption. for eg: us only has federal, state, county/municipal governments

what do you think? would this system be better? is it possible to push for such a reform?"

i'm looking at this factors before purchasing:

1. low action: it should feel smooth like butter so since i'm used to playing electric guitars which have a low action.
2. should not be hard to press the strings otherwise hands get tired.
3. i prefer the cutaway or the dreadnought cutaway shape the most, though i am open to other shapes as well.

also open to other recommendations that i can buy in india. i found [bajaao.com](http://bajaao.com) which sells a lot of good brands. can someone please help?

the red flags we ignored (wish we hadn’t)

* unprofessional &amp; avoidant – calls go unanswered, emails (8+ since march 4) are ignored, and every time we reach someone, they just pass the responsibility around. one rep even had the audacity to say they won’t take us as clients anymore—after taking our money. no desire to address any issue or return any money
* unpaid maintenance &amp; rent confusion – the society manager warned that electricity will be cut off because xu hasn’t paid jan-march maintenance, which they were contractually responsible for.
* ₹1l+ security deposit &amp; no receipt – we paid a six-figure deposit, and despite endless follow-ups, xu refuses to provide an official receipt. seriously sketchy.
* business head called himself a goon – when we escalated, the business head straight-up said he’s a goon and will “see what the police does.” if this is how they treat tenants, imagine their ethics.

we were supposed to move in on march 1, but due to all these red flags, we haven’t even signed the contract yet. after two weeks of chasing them, we just want our money back.

the worst rental experience of our lives.

we’ve dealt with bad landlords and difficult agents before, but this is on another level. zero accountability, blatant financial mismanagement, and complete disregard for tenants. it’s shocking how a company can operate like this.

if you’ve had similar experiences—especially with xu lifestyle—let’s talk. tenants deserve transparency, respect, and professionalism. like, comment, and share so this reaches the right people!"

1. i cannot remove shows/movies from the currenty watching row. i have tried multiple times. there is a cross right there in the top right. i click it. nothing happens. turns out we can only remove these tiles from the mobile app. why?? this comes from jio. it was working fine in the old disney+hotstar days. 

2. opening any show or page is buggy. here is a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/ilxjrwf) of what i see when i click on any tile. here is another [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/yzpipz4) go to the homescreen. you see a show or movie you want to watch. you click on it. and the site does not show anything. you reload the page and then the ""movie/show page"" opens. why do i need to referesh the page everytime i want to know the details of a show or a movie. the only option that does actually work is play/watch button. but maybe i want to rewatch an old episode. maybe i want to watch the next episode. i can still bear the movie page not opening since that has no information essentially (but that is a rant for another day) but show pages need to open. please. and this comes from hotstar. not jio. it does not work. never did.

both of the above work on mobile app perfectly. i do not use the mobile app. i do not want to use the mobile app. this is not how you do cross platform features. i want to watch content on a bigger screen. 


edit: looks like they fixed it.

reddit,2025-03-14 17:06:46,"is tesla’s entry in india overhyped? the real impact of lower import tariffs i see a lot of excitement about tesla’s potential entry into india due to reduced import tariffs, along with praise for trump’s reciprocal tariff policy. but is this really good for india’s economy and manufacturing sector?

if we lower import tariffs across the board, it won’t just bring “competition” for indian brands—it could kill them. why? because companies won’t feel the need to set up manufacturing or assembly units in india anymore. instead, they’ll just import from china, vietnam, or other low-cost countries, undercutting local brands like tata, mahindra (born electric), and others.

the impact? fewer factories, fewer jobs, and more reliance on foreign-made products—completely going against the make in india and made in india initiatives. with our population growing, do we really want to risk reducing job opportunities in manufacturing?

also, is tesla’s entry really that big of a deal? we already have solid ev options from tata and mahindra. tesla isn’t magically solving ev infrastructure problems in india either—charging stations, grid readiness, and affordability remain key challenges.

are we overhyping tesla while ignoring the bigger economic consequences? would love to hear your thoughts!

saw some videos on instagram where women got unwanted approaches/touches, that just changed my whole mood, although some reels were funny, but this remained in my mind, 
i changed the platform, came on reddit, here also, saw some post where women have shared, their stories about harassment/unwanted touches by some creeps, and not only women, a boy earlier today shared the traumatizing experience happened with him.

out of curiosity i searched ""holi"" on search section of reddit, the posts were full of, ""uncomfortable touches"" &amp; ""traumatizing experience"", shared by people. 

i can't even blame my feed or the content that i am consuming because i myself, while growing up heard some stories like this or saw some fights/chaos happening where some creep happened to be the culprit and made some woman uncomfortable.

this festival is great, but the creeps are ruining it.

reddit,2025-03-15 13:02:54,"the shadow war doctrine: r&amp;aw’s 1970s strategy in south asia. do you see any parallels? paliwal, avinash. “losing the peace: famine, coup, and countercoup in bangladesh.” *india’s near east: a new history*, penguin books, 2024, pp. 212-214.

but india continued to make the same mistakes. officials reaffirmed their faith in india’s central aims in bangladesh after 1975: prevent anti-indian powers from using bangladesh as an ops base against india, and prevent hindu exodus. but the prescription was more of the same, i.e. to have a ‘friendly government’ in dacca and forge ‘mutually advantageous links’ as bangladesh became ‘more and more involved with india’. it was an acknowledgement that india still viewed bangladesh as a dependency.

why was there a difference between theory and practice? this is where india’s hegemonic ambitions and domestic insecurities come into view. the self-critical note offered a patronising psychological analysis of bangladesh. first, ‘intense anti-india and anti-hindu propaganda’ before 1971 left a ‘residue’ in the subconscious muslim minds. second, the disconnect between east pakistan and india meant that bangladeshis didn’t understand india and believed all propaganda (despite the report acknowledging that bangladeshi charges against india after 1971 were accurate). third, being a small new nation, bangladesh had a ‘natural sense of inferiority, which every ‘aided’ nation resents’.

the note advocated a ‘mature’ long-term approach that aimed to strengthen pro-india lobbies, and sought a ‘cultural conquest’ that would expose bangladeshis to indian secularism and ally with the soviets to forestall the us-china-pakistan nexus. anything that undermined india’s ‘unipolarity in bangladesh’ in the long term must be avoided. but in the near future, new delhi had to convince zia not to confront india. on 2 january 1976, r&amp;aw joint secretary n framji suntook, who became chief of r&amp;aw a year later, authored a top-secret note on the strengths and weaknesses of the bangladeshi government and the opposition groups such as the jsd and kader bahini. he noted that ‘emphasis on islamic identity by the majority community’ coupled with the rise of china and pakistan was bad for india. suntook listed what pakistan’s mission would do in bangladesh and how india must ‘counteract’.

in r&amp;aw’s reading, pakistan was planning to post 100–150 personnel in dacca and open a consulate in chittagong. such a footprint would allow the isi to exploit the ‘old boys network’, and have pervasive influence in bangladeshi ministries. it risked exposing india’s problems with bangladesh ‘from a to z’ making pakistan the ‘invisible third party exercising influence’ in bilateral negotiations on boundary settlement and water sharing. pakistan could infiltrate bangladeshi media and educational institutions to foment pro-islamic, pro-pakistani feelings, and encourage anti-india and anti-hindu sentiments.

once things started going their way, ‘pakistan may promote the idea of a confederation’ with bangladesh. why? because bhutto viewed bangladesh’s proximity to india’s northeast as a strategic advantage and believed this region ‘had the potential of developing into another viet nam’. true to style, bhutto met with mizo rebel leader laldenga in 1973 to reassess pakistan’s support after the 1971 setback. suntook believed that pakistan would also support naxalites and fuel disaffection against india in nepal. zia’s conservative nationalism, viewed from this perspective, was anathema.

suntook recommended an aggressive campaign. for starters, india needed to broaden and deepen its intelligence gathering system to track pakistani operations. such measures included cross-governmental coordination with the state trading corporation, aid, shipping, coal board, and so on who dealt with bangladesh. suntook proposed maintaining ‘steady pressure’ on dacca about pakistani activities, and to ‘make it clear to the leaders of bengla desh that their alignment with pakistan would pose a threat to our security and would not be acceptable beyond a point’. close cultural ties that ‘keep the memories of the freedom struggle’ and the ‘atrocities committed by pakistan alive’ were also recommended. for this, the scale of india’s cultural activities needed to be on a scale ‘comparable to that of the americans and the russians in india’.

but there was a sharper edge to r&amp;aw’s strategy. after mapping out the who’s who that could target zia’, suntook recommended all ‘feasible measures’ to ‘soften up areas which are contiguous to indian territories’. in security parlance, this meant arming the shanti and kader bahinis, and al rebels such as suttar (known to r&amp;aw as ‘chittu babu’).

then came suntook’s final blow:

&gt;…serious thought should be given to the idea of providing strong support to anti-pakistani activities in nwfp, and baluchistan now being carried on from bases in afghanistan. to relieve pakistani pressure on india through bengla desh, it may be necessary to intensify pressure on pakistan through afghanistan to the extent that it is feasible to do so.

suntook’s recommendations echoed bureaucratic consensus and became policy until gandhi lost power in march 1977. zia came to believe that r&amp;aw was after his life. after coming to power, he prevented an indian intervention by not declaring bangladesh an islamic republic. but he faced intense pressure by anti-regime elements, all of whom received covert indian support. officially, india communicated to the us that it was ‘calm and cool’ about bangladesh and acknowledged that large-scale persecution of hindus was not happening. unofficially, it pressured zia.

us intelligence noted that the bsf opened more training camps after november 1975 for anti-zia rebels. by august 1976, india helped an estimated ‘two to three thousand’ such elements to cross over into bangladesh. cross-border violence by india-trained rebels became routine in 1976. such kinetic support to the shanti bahni was accompanied by relocation of chakma refugees to arunachal pradesh. to augment infiltration, the bsf launched a big operation on 20 april 1976 at the bandarkata border post in mymensingh. sylhet and the meghalaya-tangail/mymensigh border areas were specific points where india increased pressure. many of these india-trained ‘miscreants’ created ‘instability’ with the ‘ultimate objective of overthrowing the existing government’.

certain members of the gono bahini, the jsd’s armed wing, joined the kader bahini. by may 1976, india had trained the first batch of shanti bahini fighters in dehradun and haflong, assam. by 1979, 700 chakma fighters received training and most of the 150,000 displaced chakmas were relocated. just before gandhi lost power, r&amp;aw asked the shanti bahini for a ‘big push forward’ with the promise of expanding its cadre to 15,000. for his part, suttar intensified the bangabhumi movement for a separate hindu state in bangladesh. little understood, the bangabhumi movement resonated with bangladeshi hindus. ‘our relationship with suttar was very benign’ and the operational understanding ‘deep’ says an indian intelligence officer with knowledge of these matters.

reddit,2025-03-16 17:32:53,"overflow of hollow anger in india. recently i saw news about a scientist dying after an assault by his neighbour in a mere parking dispute. some people are saying people in india are losing empathy and easily succumb to anger. perhaps it's correct.

you can see it even in movies. javed akhtar, reflecting on the ""angry young man"" archetype in bollywood, stated that amitabh bachchan's anger was rooted in deep hurt about injustice, while contemporary ""angry man"" archetype in movies like animal lack that underlying pain, leading to a decline in both character depth and creating a hollow story.  i think he is correct, and it shows even in real life, even among the educated lower and upper middle class people.

you can see politicians talking about breaking structures, social media ""activists"" justifying riots and violence as ""justice"", no tolerance for free speech regarding artificially created ""sensitive"" issues. tv media never showing an empathetic depiction of any community. justice and police system still don't work to solve issues smoothly. 'vigilantes' showing their ""anger"" on roads without any respect for law , or even humanity. women still suffer violent crimes in large numbers, while news about some caste-religion violence comes everyday. aside from no change in people's mindset, there is also no police or judicial reforms to address it. even the new nyaya samhita is just a copy paste of the old colonial laws, giving excess power to the state with little corresponding responsibility.

the whole society feels sick, and neither the people in power nor the people connected to them seriously work to address this loss of empathy and overflow of self-obsessed anger. a person may punch a neighbour when he throws some garbage infront of his house, but feels nothing when a sewage line stays broken for years, as if he has given up on the state and society.
religion is made ""cool"" by media and social media, but no focus on the philosophy of tolerance and compassion. instead those pretentious prlcks who abuse and shout a lot against other people, other communities, etc get more publicity. 

even outside india,  indians are getting less empathy. foreign tourist come less year by year, and the videos of indians quarreling and screaming at each other in rushed railway stations and bus stands are popular in all countries, even in non-english speaking social media.

i hope this is just a period in transition and things get better."

i have taken the scooter to the service center multiple times. they have replaced the motor, parts, and even the controller, but the issue is still not resolved. the technicians have tried everything they could, but they cannot fix this.

i don’t know what to do now. i regret buying this scooter.

thinking about mobile, much talk about business: how many crores for spectrum, who owns what percentage of which network, which company merged with which, what the arpu of different networks are. yet the only technology bits i hear about are 3g, 4g, 5g. 

digging a little deeper, you get to hear how much mhz of spectrum. even mention of gsm/edge/wcdma/hspa/hspa+/lte/lte-a/nr are rare, but never utra and e-utra. tdd and fdd sometimes also figure. you hear about fiber rollout, but rarely how much bandwidth. some rare info like agreements on call ringing length leaks out when trai and dot disagree sometimes. 

its even worse with fixed line: bsnl is the only one who releases any info about anything because of nib and nib-ii, such as the bandwidth of their links between cities (surprisingly low). absolutely no mention of sonet/sdh for example. i hear about mpls primarily from the internet people, not the telecom people.

otherwise all i see is literal mention of the word ""technology"", ""advanced technology"", and ""digital technology"" when it comes to landlines, etc, but nothing actually about it. there's more info floating around about india's nuclear power technology or even defense tech, than india's telecom technology.... or is there? 

are there places where people talk a lot about ss7 upgrades? routing tables? copper snrs? ofc selection? dslam configuration? atm vs metro ethernet? g.711 voice codecs? iptv vci/vpis? isdn bri?

my father spent all day and night yesterday trying to sell a lorry load of paddy to buyers. not for profit but at the bare minimum of the cost price. none of the farmers were even asking for a profit. and all the buyers bully the farmers to sell it at a loss. and where can the farmers go now? they’ve brought this lorry load from 450 km away. they can’t turn the lorry back and they can’t wait there for 4 days since it’s festival and the buyers go for their holidays. what can they do? he and the others sold it at a loss. he called back home in tears. broke my family’s hearts. my heart. 

it was months of work growing the crops. so much care. so much hard work. when we buy a kilo of rice from the store / get it delivered on an app, we don’t understand the incredible hard work the farmers go through. they run to the fields each night if the motors don’t work. no electricity. sweltering heat during the day. i have seen their legs rip open and bleed because of the fields and they pay it no mind. they bear the pain of the bloody gashes on their legs for days because they can’t leave the fields during those crucial days. men and women. they have to pray for rains to either come or go depending on what the crops need. and they put their blood, sweat, and tears into growing the crops that all of us need to survive. and all for what? to be bullied because we can’t afford huge warehouses to hoard our grain like the big players. we’re not wealthy enough own mills to process them ourselves and sell it at a 10x markup. we have to sell them before the rains start otherwise it’s all ruined. so people play with our helplessness. 

i’m so angry and frustrated and helpless for my father and the other farmers that went with him. most of the village is gonna be at a loss even after growing thousands of kilos of paddy. i will be able to send money back home because of my job. but what about the other farmers who went with with my father? what will they do for money? some are so poor that they will rely on rations from the government to feed their families. i know such families. 

i’m educated enough to know reddit and vent my helplessness and frustration out here. where can they go? 

they’re gonna go back home to their families today and tell them that couldn’t get any profit home even though they are feeding their fellow indians. 

please spare a prayer for all us farmers the next time you eat your biryani or your thai green curry. know that we couldn’t even make a rupee off of growing the rice that you’re eating. 

and please, please, please, don’t waste food. only farmers know the pain of growing it. 

i apologise if i’ve offended anyone reading by something i’ve said. please correct me if i’m wrong about something. 

tldr - demotivated to be a farmer in india. father and other farmers sold their grain at loss. 



edit - want to thank the community for the responses. i found value in each one. i wrote the post when i was irrational and upset. as i continued to read the comments, i was moved by the number of people who jumped into problem solving instead of just telling me to grow up. i do have a lot of growing up to do. i also have to do a lot of research and figure this out. if there is anyone who might want to collaborate or share advice / wisdom, pls do reach out. i want to learn from those who have figured it out. that will help me determine if those solutions suit my village’s needs."

recently in the thanisandra main road a child died due to reckless drunk driving by a bbmp waste collection truck driver(i witnessed the man not being in a sane state of mind, either he was drunk or was under the influence of something else). my society had requested the mla of our constituency for a speed breaker to avoid such accidents as 2 people died in january, but he just puts the blame on us and was like we should drive safely it's an airport road. my question is if it's an airport road why isn't the road planned properly to avoid accidents, it's not even planned properly with various intersecting junctions. speed breakers and foot over bridges are the bare minimum, it's high time bbmp gets elected representatives to ensure accountability."

i see garbage collectors working and cleaning every few days. they come, sweep it all up, very good job. so i can’t even say the government or anyone higher didn’t do their part. but these shops? next day, they bring the trash dump back like nothing happened! what’s the point of cleaning if they’re just going to dirty it again? the roads outside turn into garbage dumps and then they expect us to walk in and shop like it’s all okay. hypocrisy level 100! if these shop owners won’t clean up their act, maybe shaming them with bad reviews will wake them up. or at least make them think twice. what’s your take?"
reddit,2025-04-05 12:51:42,"tired of the blatant lack of civic sense i don’t usually rant on reddit, but this has been boiling inside me for a long time.

i live in ncr, and every single day, i wake up to the sight of household garbage *dumped right on the street*, clearly visible from my balcony. plastic bags, food waste, construction debris,  you name it. it’s just lying there, rotting. no matter how “developed” this place claims to be, the basic sense of cleanliness and civic responsibility is *completely missing*.

it’s frustrating to see the apathy toward garbage disposal. people treat their littering as someone else’s responsibility. this issue is about personal accountability, not just education. i’ve seen this for over 20 years now, and still *nothing* has changed.

we can’t keep blaming the government for everything when people themselves refuse to act like decent citizens. why is it so hard not to throw trash on the road?

what angers me even more is that these are the same people who march on road on 26 jan and 15 aug chanting ""bharat mata ki jai"".

i don’t know what it will take to change this society. maybe we need to start calling this behavior out publicly. maybe we need a serious dose of social shame.

i am so glad i'll be moving out from here soon."
reddit,2025-04-05 23:03:53,"i hate hate hatee this country, india and my life here i hate this country. i hate that i was born here in india. being born here feels like a curse, at least for me. so, for starters, i’m a 16 yr old transgender boy, born and raised in india. i have several valid reasons for absolutely despising this country from the very core of my soul. let’s begin with the people, yep, the very proud *citizens* of india. you all know how insanely diverse this country is, right? every state is like its own little country with different cultural practices, languages, shows, etc. but here’s a list of reasons why i think this country is a failure (there are *way* more, but these ones rlly piss me off):

1. **extreme pride**: so many indians, both online and in real life, have this *ridiculous* inflated sense of pride. they believe india is superior to every other country and that it’s the absolute best. in reality? it’s not lol. they’re just too delusional to see it.

2. **racism**: yep, racism. indians are some of the most racist people, *especially* towards fellow indians. if you’re dark skinned indian, other indians won’t hesitate to throw disgusting, racist comments at you. 

3. **caste system**: can we talk about how messed up it is that we *still* have a caste system? like, in 2025? seriously?

4. **lack of civic sense**: indians, as a whole, lack *basic* civic sense. and no, you can’t just blame illiteracy because even well-educated, wealthy people throw trash in the streets like it’s their personal garbage bin. they’re out here littering the country and then turning around to say how “beautiful” and “better than other countries” it is. the irony is painful to say the least.

5. **judgemental society**: everyone's got an opinion about you and they will make sure you hear it. whether it's your clothes, career choices, gender, or who you love, you're *constantly* judged, scrutinized and looked down upon. privacy is a complete joke here.

6. **corruption everywhere**: bribery and corruption are so normal here, it's practically part of daily life. need basic services? better know someone or be ready to pay off some official. the system isn’t broken, it literally functions like this.

7. **glorifying suffering**: struggles are romanticized here. instead of fixing problems, people flex how much *pain* they’ve tolerated. it’s always “we survived worse” instead of “we deserve better.” it’s toxic asl.

8. **education system:** don’t even get me started on the education system. it kills creativity, mental health, and individuality. it’s just rote learning, unrealistic expectations, toxic competition and zero space for personal growth. nobody gives a damn about what you actually want to do. there ain't much scope for careers like architecture, art, etc. it's always either engineer, doctor or lawyer.

9. **queerphobia/transphobia**: being queer or trans in india is like asking to be treated like trash. people stare, mock, misgender, harass, and dehumanize you for simply existing. it's not just strangers, sometimes it's your own family, school, teachers, doctors. support is rare and safe spaces? almost nonexistent in this country. 

10. **toxic conservatism**: this country is too obsessed with clinging to outdated traditions and moral policing. people here act like personal freedom is a threat to society. wear what you want? you're “asking for it.” speak up? “you're too westernized.” think differently? “disrespectful.”

11. **indians are the biggest hypocrites**: indians l.o.v.e. preaching “respect,” “tradition,” and “values” but where is that energy when women are getting harassed in broad daylight every other day? when people are abused for their caste or identity? it's all fake, performative morality.

12. **forced patriotism**: you can’t criticize the country without being called “anti national.” like sorry bro, wanting a country to be better isn’t hating it, it’s expecting *basic* humanity. but people here just don’t get that. they’d rather live in denial than face the truth.

13. **neglected mental health**: mental health is either ignored or mocked in india. there aren't enough therapists, especially queer affirming ones. public hospitals barely have mental health professionals and private help is expensive. plus, families often dismiss it as “drama” or “attention seeking.” you're left to fight your mind alone. that's another reason why depression and suicide rates in india are rising rapidly.

anyway, i'm done for now. there are a lot more issues i cannot mention in this post. these were just a few i've observed and personally experienced in my 16 years of living here.

edit: 
here are 12 more issues i've seen because some of y'all just won't sthu and accept how flawed your country really is. someone needs to speak up. :

14. **poverty ignored**: india loves showing off its billionaires and skyscrapers, but what about the millions living in slums, without any clean water or food? poverty here isn’t just a “developing country issue” it’s a systemic failure that both, the government and society conveniently ignore.

15. **rape culture**: the number of rape cases reported in india is jst horrifying and that’s *just* the reported ones. victim blaming is so common, police often refuse to file complaints and rapists walk free while survivors are shamed and silenced.

16. **fake democracy**: india claims to be the “largest democracy,” but in reality? voices are silenced, dissent is criminalized, journalists are jailed and elections are full of manipulation. it’s a democracy in *name only*. 

17. **religious extremism**: religion has become a political weapon in india. hate crimes, riots and lynchings happen in the name of faith. if you don’t belong to the majority religion, you’re automatically “less indian” in many people’s eyes.

18. **patriarchy everywhere**: this society still treats women like shit, 2nd class citizens. from birth, girls are told to stay quiet, sacrifice their dreams, and prioritize everyone else. feminism is mocked and asking for equal rights is treated like a threat still. female infanticide still exists in several parts of india. 

19. **lack of accessibility**: india is extremely unfriendly to disabled people. public spaces rarely have ramps, accessible transport is almost non existent and inclusive education is a joke. it’s like people with disabilities are invisible here.

20. **fake progress**: this country loves to brag about development but it’s mostly jst surface level. a few metro cities might look shiny, but rural areas still lack basic healthcare, clean drinking water and decent roads. 

21. **toxic nationalism in schools**: kids are brainwashed from a very young age to blindly worship the country. there’s zero room for questioning history, policies or even basic facts. you’re taught to obey, not to think.

22. **zero work-life balance**: the culture here is so toxic. people are expected to overwork, underpaid jobs are normalized and taking care of your mental health is seen as laziness like i mentioned earlier. rest is treated like a luxury, not a necessity.

23. **no legal protection for queer relationships**: queer people still can’t legally marry, adopt, or even access basic relationship rights. the government refuses to recognize lgbtqia+ people as equal citizens because we “don’t align with indian culture.”

24. **brain drain**: talented people keep leaving india. why? because the environment here is so hostile to creativity, to freedom, to ambition. if you're smart and different, this country will try to shut you down. 

25. **no sex education**: there’s zero proper sex ed in most schools. as a result, kids grow up clueless about consent, safety, and bodies leading to abuse, unplanned pregnancies, and shame. it’s a public health crisis no one wants to fix. that’s also a huge reason why india has such an overwhelming and unmanageable population because people aren’t taught how not to contribute to it.

**anyway, i’m done fr now. the so-called ""indians"" in the comments are doing a flawless job proving every single point i made. it’s honestly just embarrassing and disgusting at this point lmao.**

*edit 2* : to those saying i should just leave india, i definitely will. i’ve wanted to for a long time. but it won’t be an escape, it’ll be a choice. like anyone else, i just want to live a good life. i know i deserve better regardless of what other ppl have to say. if i can feel welcome and find love, freedom, safety, and acceptance in another country, things my birth country never gave me, then i’ll leave without hesitation.

*edit 3* : and to those saying my post was written by ai, i appreciate the accidental compliment lol. i guess my writing’s finally leveling up!"

reddit,2025-04-07 14:21:06,"observations of a msme business owner as a msme owner, here are my observations :

india is way backwards in creating value addition companies on a larger scale and at a more frequency because:

1) there is no level playing field amongst the states.

2) rampant corruption at all levels, it will create a disproportionate disadvantage for companies who want to play ethically because of higher initial costs. 

3) district level/ zonal officers are not taking steps to stay connected with the industries, understand their problems or be a bridge for easier implementation of government schemes. 

4) lack of good quality infrastructure ( roads, railways, flyovers, airports) . major major issue in my opinion as it causes loss of innumerable man hours. ( example building a fly over takes a year, while causing traffic jams till the time is completed ). it might look like a silly example but, it hampers the efficiency of all businesses dependent on that road. 

5) mediocre quality products and its supply chain &gt; high quality products leading to cut throat margins , leading to lesser incentivsation for companies to invest in r&amp;d. we are not seeing any practical examples of companies who have invested in r&amp;d and reaped rewards in indian business scenario.

""no sanskaar."" ""must be sleeping around."" ""she's asking for it."" ""this is why girls need to be controlled."" these aren't burner accounts. these are actual people. real names, real faces, sometimes standing next to their daughters in the display picture. the hypocrisy doesn't even shame them. they post one status about lord ram and in the next breath they’re calling a woman a whore because she wore shorts. these men aren’t conservative. they’re just pathetic. desperate. disgusting. and loud.

they hide behind “culture” like it’s a get-out-of-jail-free card for being human garbage. but this isn’t culture. this is unchecked rot. this is a failed nation screaming through every comment section.

i’m not exaggerating at all. open any reel. any woman creator. scroll. it's not abuse here and there, it's everywhere. every platform, every language. north or south, doesn't matter. in the south, it's a caste circus too. ""thalapathy fans are jobless."" ""your actor is a zero. mine is god."" ""caste slurs, because why not? "" films become war zones. memes become caste manifestos. everyone's yelling. no one's thinking. just anger. and more anger.

infinite, helpless anger, disguised as ""feedback.""

""get raped and then dance, let's see."" she complained. nothing occurred. she took down the post. they won. that's the game these days. get women to delete themselves.

we scroll over it like it means nothing. we've made it normal. we anticipate it. we tolerate it.

the internet used to be strange and quirky and freeing. now it's like being nude in the street with 500 people yelling at you. it's not about the free data. it's not even jio. it's because we gave each and every broken man in this nation a mic and didn't give him a mirror.

we didn't link india. we merely digitized its dirt. we created a sewer system across the country and labeled it ""access.""

a tweet by @.bittu\_tweetzz: gif of a man licking fingers. caption: ""mrunal's gynaecologist."" that's it. that's the joke. a woman visits a doctor, and the ""humorous"" aspect is to sexualize it. this isn't humor. this is what brain death looks like when you provide it wifi.

they will always find a way to blame the woman

reddit,2025-04-10 13:51:29,"the frustration behind traffic jams in india — roads aren’t even that bad! i’m really frustrated with the traffic situation in india. despite having decent infrastructure in many places, it seems like basic driving rules are either ignored or forgotten, making traffic jams far worse than they need to be.

one of the most irritating things is when left turns are free turns (i.e., you don’t have to wait for the light to go green), but you still can’t take them. why? because drivers who are supposed to turn right are blocking the left turn lane. so, when the light finally turns green, these drivers, who should be in the right-most lane, cut across and force everyone who wants to go straight to stop and let them in. it’s just poor lane discipline, and it causes delays for everyone.

another issue is drivers who need to turn right, but for some reason, they’re not in the right-most lane. they end up in the left lanes and block the flow of traffic, then try to squeeze into the right lane at the last second, causing unnecessary chaos for everyone else trying to go straight.

and then, of course, there are the auto drivers. they seem to have zero concern for anyone else on the road. they cut across without hesitation, squeezing through gaps that are way too small. if they happen to cause any minor damage, it’s like they couldn’t care less and just move on like nothing happened.

honestly, the traffic wouldn’t be *that* bad if everyone just followed basic lane discipline. the infrastructure in many parts of the country is actually improving, but it’s the utter lack of road manners that makes everything worse. i’ve driven in other countries where people follow lane rules properly, and traffic flows much more smoothly. it’s frustrating to see that something as simple as lane discipline could make such a huge difference here.

with the high number of traffic lights and the ever-growing number of vehicles on the road, the lack of basic driving etiquette just makes everything more chaotic. the roads themselves aren’t the problem — it’s the drivers who create the real bottleneck.

anyone else feeling the same way? sometimes it feels like basic road manners could make a huge difference in how traffic moves, but it seems like that’s too much to ask."
reddit,2025-04-11 07:15:17,"the warmest room in the house i’m 24m, a law graduate from one of those tier-1 colleges that everyone talks about at family functions and linkedin posts. most of my batchmates went off to metro cities, picked up corporate jobs( sam, cam, trilegal blah blah) and settled into the high-rise life. i could’ve done the same. i had the offers. the interviews had gone well. but something inside me pulled me back home—to jaipur, to the old house where every wall holds a memory.

i chose a government job. simple. stable. close to home. people raised eyebrows. “why?” they asked. “you’ll waste your potential,” someone even said. but i never saw it that way. and lately, i’ve been more sure than ever that i made the right choice.

a few days ago, i fell sick. nothing dramatic—just a stubborn fever that wouldn’t go away. but it was the kind of illness that makes everything feel heavier—your limbs, your thoughts, even the light from the window.

i stayed in bed for days. i barely spoke. i didn’t have the energy to even pretend to work. but my parents… they turned those days into something soft, something warm. they didn’t ask for anything. they just showed up—in small, steady ways that meant everything.

my mother brought me warm khichdi and sat beside me, her fingers running through my hair like she used to when i was a child. she would talk about random things—the neighbours’ new paint job, how the coriander in her pots was finally growing, how i used to hate milk but now it was all i’d drink without arguing.

my father, who’s not usually very expressive, surprised me. he started making kadha himself—his own recipe, full of ginger and all the things he believed in. “this will burn the fever out,” he said one morning, placing the cup next to my bed like it was some sacred potion. he cracked terrible jokes just to make me smile, and somehow, that helped more than any tablet i took.

one night, when i was half-awake and sweating from the fever, i opened my eyes and saw both of them sitting quietly in my room. my mother was knitting. my father was scrolling through the phone, probably seeing the inshorts news (he’s gotten habituated to inshorts these days since i told him about it.) they weren’t saying anything, but their presence filled the room. when she noticed i was awake, ma touched my forehead gently and said, “thoda kam lag raha hai aaj.” my father looked up and gave a small nod, nothing dramatic, but enough to make me feel like i wasn’t fighting this alone.

and in that dimly lit room, with the fan humming overhead and the comfort of their silence, i felt a kind of peace i hadn’t felt in a long time.

as i started recovering, the house came back to life with me. ma insisted on feeding me with her hands sometimes, just like old days. papa brought home fresh flowers once, said he got them from the market, but i knew he had picked them from the little park near the post office. he thought i wouldn’t notice. i didn’t say anything.

we started spending evenings on the terrace again. wrapped in a shawl, sipping tea, i’d listen to them talk. ma would dream aloud about starting a herb garden. papa would complain about potholes and politics. i didn’t say much. i just listened. i felt stitched back into something that had always been there, waiting.

last night, at dinner, ma made my favourite sabzi without asking. papa acted like the news was more important, but i caught him watching my plate to see if i was eating properly. that quiet kind of love—that’s what fills this house. not loud, not dramatic. just there. constant.

i often think about those cities i could’ve gone to—the glass towers, the speed, the chaos, the money. but then i look around this house—the chipped paint, the sounds from the kitchen, the way ma hums old songs without noticing, the way papa switches off the lights exactly at 10:30—and i know i’m exactly where i’m supposed to be.

this house didn’t just help me recover from a fever. it reminded me of who i am, and who i’ll always be.

sometimes, the warmest room in the world is the one you never had to earn—just return to."
reddit,2025-04-11 15:52:32,"are we really living in a society — or just surviving in a jungle with buildings? lately, i’ve been feeling like india doesn’t function like a true society. when i’m in traffic, it’s pure chaos. everyone just goes their own way, no sense of order. and unless there’s a cop standing right there, no one follows rules. it reminds me of a forest — where animals do whatever they want, unless they see the lion. here, people only fear the police in the moment. otherwise, there’s no accountability.

but this behavior isn’t just limited to the roads. take healthcare — it’s still struggling in many parts of the country. or food safety — everyone knows we’re consuming harmful levels of pesticides. it’s an open secret, yet nothing changes. isn’t it the government’s job to protect its people from this? why is it so easy for life-threatening issues to be ignored?

a big part of the problem, in my opinion, is overpopulation. the number of people has grown far beyond what our systems can handle — whether it’s hospitals, roads, education, or governance. when there are too many people and not enough resources, survival becomes individualistic. and unfortunately, i don’t see strong steps being taken toward population control. it’s treated like a taboo topic.

so even though we live in buildings, use smartphones, and call it a “society” — deep down, it often feels like the jungle. no order, no real consequences, and everyone looking out for themselves.

have we stopped expecting better? or are we so used to this chaos that it feels normal now?

reddit,2025-04-11 18:25:14,"regular cases of sexual violence in india: thinking beyond surface level outrage. the recent varanasi rape case might assemble people to outrage once again because its news has gone viral. this outrage is a little too soon this time. just 8 months after the kolkata case. everyday news of rapes here and there does not call for action and only takes one scroll to get over with.

official data shows that around 30,000 rape cases are reported in india every year. but:

* we also have a sense that not all cases (especially when family is involved, or marital rapes) are reported to the authorities.
* the conviction rate in the reported cases is ridiculously low.
* public anger tends to erupt only when a case becomes ""viral"" — if it fits the pattern that media and algorithms reward.

even in those cases, we never really go beyond, ""hang the rapists publically"" or ""cut off their genitals"" etc. **rape is not a deviation from society, it is a reflection of how society is built**"".



before figuring out what punishment is best for which crime, it is necessary to look for the reasons.

* **patriarchy** hands over this power to men. it limits the movement and freedom of the majority of women, which makes them secluded at home and in public spaces.
* in **caste hierarchies,** the ""upper"" caste men assert dominance on the one hand by restricting women's relationships and on the other hand through sexual violence towards women from other castes. urban sexual violence often gets media coverage — but rural and caste-based violence is normalized and invisibilized.
* **capitalism and the capitalist mode of production** thrive on profit and competition. the competition and the economic despair among the low-income workers lead to their alienation from society, killing community living. the more the alienation, the more disempowered and violent men become physically and verbally.
* in such **capitalist** systems, the least powerful are the women from lower-income households, especially from dalit, bahujan, and adivasi communities. you'd say, ""but america is also capitalist"". america and europe do not thrive on their own. they stand at the top of the capitalist structure exploiting the global south population since forever.
* the capitalist mode of production also thrives on the objectification of women. other than marketing and films, it brings social media numbers. the alienated men feel empowered when they collectively ridicule the oppressed. in other words, the more dank, edgy (or insensitive) your comedian or commenter is, the more clout he brings to the systems furthering the chain of alienation.

* this whole ecosystem of conservative and liberal media (news, films, comedy, ads, social media content, etc) ignores the daily systemic violence in homes, fields, factories, and police stations that feeds the larger picture. but if a popular woman says anything south of what our patriarchal values taught us, she is a feminist and feminism is getting out of hand.

reddit,2025-04-15 10:50:26,"if you’re against reservation, fine—but why upper cast deny the reality of caste discrimination? still million face extream caste discrimination (data &amp; ground reports inside) why do upper castes against reservation refuse to acknowledge ongoing dalit oppression? in multiple debate i listen there is no discrimination; everyone is equal but it is white lie

i get it—reservation is a contentious topic. some believe it’s ""unfair,"" ""outdated,"" or even ""reverse discrimination."" but here’s what baffles me: why do so many upper-caste critics outright deny that caste oppression it still exists, especially in tier 3/4 cities and villages? ( before you ask my cast it is bhumiar or local land holder i work as volunteer in education to backward child in up where i see contrast in discrimination i did allow lower-caste child and upper cast child to play together and next day i and my team was getting scolded for it ).

you can oppose reservation—that’s your right. but ignoring the brutal reality of caste violence, segregation, and economic apartheid is just dishonest. let’s talk facts:

violence against dalits is still rampant national crime records bureau (ncrb) 2022: over 50,000 crimes against sc/sts reported—that’s 10 crimes per hour.

uttar pradesh, rajasthan, bihar top the list, but underreporting is massive in rural areas.

manual scavenging deaths: 90% are dalits. over 1,000 deaths in sewers since 2017 (safai karmachari andolan data).

2. social boycott &amp; segregation un report (2023): 1 in 4 dalits faces segregation in temples, water sources, and even crematoriums.

village studies (anand teltumbde, 2021): in maharashtra/mp, dalits are barred from entering upper-caste homes, using common wells.

two-glass system: still practiced in parts of karnataka, tamil nadu, where dalits are served tea in separate cups.

3. economic oppression oxfam india (2023): sc/st households earn 30% less than national avg. land ownership? just 9% of dalits own land.

nsso data: only 5% of dalits reach higher education vs 15% for upper castes.

4. denial is the problem the argument that ""casteism is dead"" is a luxury only savarnas can afford. ask a dalit student in a village school who sits separately. ask a dalit laborer paid less for the same work. ask the families of rohith vemula, payal tadvi, or the hathras victim.

if you’re against reservation, propose a better solution. but pretending caste injustice is ""history"" is gaslighting.

reddit,2025-04-15 12:47:36,"the actual problem maybe is not lack of civil sense but not calling out things 

hello everyone 
 
it feels just a hypocritical thing to do is that everybody rants about lack of civil sense in india but simultaneously contributing to that. 
i believe that low civil sense is a problem but it’s not only the problem the actual problem maybe normalisation of bad habits which cause others to suffer in india 

for ex i was just seeing a post of traffic jam in delhi and some other part of india in which delhi side bikers were trying to drive on footpath 
seeing the picture let’s visualise that there is a traffic jam 5 bikers will be definitely standing on the road waiting for the jam to clear but the problem in india is if one biker raises his vehicle on footpath rather then calling him out rest 4 will do the same seeing them others will do the same creating a havoc  

and i feel one the prominent reason indian’s don’t have whatever you call it guts or habit to call out wrong is that kids in india are not merrily taught to ask question but to follow commands. it’s prominently seen everywhere ( schools home tuitions everywhere don’t raises your voice to elders even if they are wrong ) due to which we have adapted it in system we don’t feel it  necessary to call out others or ask questions 


the bikers too who would still choose to stand on road might be bit more educated and have common sense but i bet none of them will call out the bikers on the footpath but they will merrily judge and cuss on them 

truly i feel rather then complaining about the lack of civil sense among we should built enough guts to start calling things out"
reddit,2025-04-17 22:50:25,"bangalore’s road safety crisis: the data, the solutions, and how we can push for change hey everyone,

i've been driving in our city for over 11 years without a single traffic violation, but i've had my share of close calls (like yesterday when a parked car suddenly pulled out while i was passing it, causing a minor rear-end collision with a two-wheeler behind me).

these experiences made me curious about what works to make roads safer, so i dove into the data. what i found was shocking - it's not just apathetic drivers causing traffic problems.

the data

- 74% of bangalore traffic deaths are pedestrians and two-wheeler riders
- 14 crashes happen every day in bangalore urban alone
- karnataka loses 12,321 lives annually to traffic crashes (2023)
- this costs our economy 3-5% of gdp nationwide
- tamil nadu cut fatalities by 18% and gujarat by 8% with coordinated safety programs - proving solutions work in indian context
- fatal crashes dropped 18% near purple line metro stations but increased 11% on feeder roads lacking proper crossings
- the framework for a points based licensing system was already added into the law through the 2020 amendment but hasn’t been implemented yet.

what actually works

1. 30 km/h school/residential zones + raised crossings (saves ~410 lives per ₹100 cr invested)
   - singapore did this and virtually eliminated school-area deaths 

2. gps speed governors for buses &amp; commercial vehicles (saves ~340 lives per ₹100 cr)
   - kenya tried this and cut fatal crashes by 30%

3. intersection improvements with atcs + ai cameras (saves ~270 lives per ₹100 cr)
   - bengaluru's pilot already cut violations by 23%

what's stopping us?

it's not knowledge - it's funding and political will. karnataka only allocates 0.14% of its transport budget to road safety while crashes drain 3-5% of gdp. and, the central government only allocated ₹273 crore (0.10% of morth's budget) towards road safety.

what can we do?

i want to draft open letters to nitin gadkari and the karnataka cm with specific policy asks. would anyone:
1. be willing to share your own near-miss stories?
2. have connections to rwas or school ptas who might support a 30km/h zone petition?
3. join a twitter/instagram campaign to highlight dangerous intersections?
4. insert your name in letter?

tl;dr: 
bangalore's roads are unnecessarily dangerous. simple, cost-effective solutions exist but aren't being implemented. let's push our government to act.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"

my old inverter battery (turbo tek platinum plus it-600) finally died and i’m looking for a long-lasting replacement, especially since i live in a rural area in india with frequent power cuts.

after doing some research, i’ve shortlisted two options:
	
     1.	eastman em200sb (200ah) – comes with 10 years warranty (60 months full + 60 months pro-rata). seems like a great deal on paper, but i don’t know much about the brand or their long-term performance and service quality.

     2.	exide invamaster imtt2000 (200ah) – trusted name, shorter warranty (5 years total), but solid after-sales support and availability.

i’m leaning toward eastman due to the warranty, but exide feels like a safer choice.

what i’d love help with:
    • anyone here using eastman em200sb or similar models? how’s the performance and after-sales service?
    • any issues with exide imtt2000 in real-world usage?
    • are there any other batteries you’d recommend in the 200ah tall tubular segment with similar or better performance/longevity?
    • also open to other options if they’ve worked better for you.

thanks in advance for your help! i’d rather spend once and get peace of mind for years."

as i grew up, i don't feel that passion anymore. everywhere i see, people are extremely toxic, every second person is trying to scam you or trying to extract more money from you. air quality have become even worse and health facilities are extremely poor. there is no improvement in food quality or anything. my entire surroundings look as it used to look 10-15 years back or even worse. earlier i used to think politicians are such a respectable people. ministers should be respected but more i learn about them, more i start to hate them. i used to worship ias, ips officers thinking they are literally god send educated people whose entire job is to make society better but even their realities are same. entire india is very much focused on religion, case and language issue. no one bothered to look after roads, traffic, health, water supply and other basic things.

our biggest failure as a society isn’t just misinformation — it’s apathy toward patterns that repeat with brutal precision. we are being trained to react, not to reflect. and that’s exactly how we’re being governed.

in the wake of the pahalgam terror attack in kashmir, arnab goswami and republic channel have reignited their signature campaign: #wewantrevenge. it’s the same old script — high-pitched rhetoric, performative patriotism, and an unmistakable push to redirect public grief into electoral capital.

we’ve seen this movie before. the last time republic channel beat the war drum like this, the 2019 elections followed. now, between november 2025 and may 2026, six states go to the polls. once again, the media frenzy seems conveniently timed.

what makes it worse is the way state machinery is feeding into this manufactured narrative. the ruling party’s official facebook page recently posted an ai-generated image of the victims, captioned: “ask religion, not caste.” the goal is clear: polarize along communal lines, not question institutional failures.

but here's where the hypocrisy becomes unbearable.

amid all this chest-thumping and talk of revenge, the indian army has quietly been reduced by 180,000 personnel over the last three years. yes — at a time when we’re shouting about national security and calling for retaliation, our defense forces are shrinking.

this isn’t just a statistic. major general g.d. bakshi, a vocal military strategist, has called out this contradiction publicly. he’s asked a simple, powerful question:
“who decided that the indian army has excess manpower? on what basis was this downsizing done — especially when we are facing real, persistent threats on multiple fronts?”

and he’s right.

how does it make sense for a country of 1.4 billion people, where over half the population is under 26 and desperate for stable employment, to cut down the size of the one institution that offers both national service and economic opportunity?

it’s baffling. at a time when we should be expanding recruitment, we’re downsizing. while young people across rural and small-town india queue up for defense exams, the opportunities are being slashed. and yet, the media tells them to bleed for the nation — not to ask why they’re being left out of its future.

but that’s the pattern, isn’t it?

stoke emotion, avoid accountability. turn pain into propaganda. convert tragedy into trps and votes.

we don’t need more slogans.
we need answers.
we don’t need more “revenge.”
we need responsibility."

instead of job offers, the narrative changed over time to internship opportunities with a total stipend of ₹45k, which was never part of the original promise.and out of hundreds of students who enrolled only 3 of them were placed ever. it felt misleading, and i saw the course fee drop from ₹75k to ₹45k for new enrollments—raising more doubts about its effectiveness.

i had to go through multiple email follow-ups, provide detailed information, and wait well past my placement deadline (march 9, 2025) to finally receive my refund after weeks of back and forth.

# key takeaways for students:

* **think twice** before enrolling in expensive pg programs promising jobs.
* **keep all payment proofs and communication records**.
* **you will have to push hard for accountability** if things don’t go as promised.
* the market condition argument is often used to deflect from actual program shortcomings.

while i’m glad i finally got my refund which was partial (49k) since they told me some of the  certifications are from outside internsalla, the time, effort, and stress it took makes me question the value of such programs.

reddit,2025-04-26 00:36:14,"road rage and delivery personnel came across a road rage incident on r/bangalore. thought about posting that comment here for discussion. most of it is the same comment.

with the increase in delivery apps of all kinds, there has been a rise in riders who are generally poor people and mostly from rural backgrounds. now the issue comes that in order to reach on time (also the rush due to those 10min deliveries which are actually a problem) these drivers (who never had the civic sense of driving on roads in the first place) end up being extremely rash drivers. multiple times i have been hit by one of these guys, while riding my bike and most of the time they tend to escape/run away.

the issue increases when you confront them. due to their sheer numbers on the streets, it does not take time for them to accumulate support. (hell the chances are you scream at one and two of his fellows are right behind you).

now 99% of the times the actual law abiding civilian (not the rider) is at a disadvantage in these cases. the police will be taking their own sweet time to come and even if they do:

a) it might be late and you have been already hit by these buffoons.

b) they were not at the scene and will be taking a neutral stance.(understandable)

c) these idiots will gang up on you and be false witnesses that it was your fault in the first place. assuming the police force tries to side with you, they have their hands tied as per procedure they have to follow. chances are you will have no one willing to support you. (in the event someone has been able to find some random person's support quit your job and go test your luck. with so much luck on your side you can sure end up a millionaire.)

considering the above things an aggrieved person(like me) has only the fight or flight option. most of the people will be taking a flight option(me included have done it a few times) or fight (also done this as it was my sister riding behind me who got hurt and my principles are to protect her at any cost).

while at the moment i cannot do a lot about it but a few of the things i do is:

1. avoid these apps as much as possible. i prefer walking to the nearest store or planning my shopping to keep my transactions at the minimum.
2. in the event i do order which is mostly food, i do not add any kind of tip. to me the delivery guy is nothing but a part of the problem(most probably a problem himself) and i am not going to encourage his business.

any thoughts on this are welcome."

but i am moving my money and planning for my next generation to be out of this country for the following reasons:

1. corruption and inept governance: i am seeing massive corruption, even larger scale than under congress previously according to dad. government officials have become greedier and there is no fear or accountability. 

there is no real effort by our political class to fix existential issues affecting our people such as pollution, broken education system and healthcare. 

2. infrastructure: we pay nearly 40% of our income in direct and indirect taxes, but i can’t even drive my car without scraping it over every second speed breaker and thudding into a pothole every few meters. building good quality roads isn’t hard, even pakistan has better roads wherever they have them. 

and one of our companies makes roads for the state government, the problem is that even if we want to provide a quality output we simply cannot. the input material (bitumen) is highly adulterated and of very low grade and we purchase all our input stock from psus only. the system will not let us make a good road. 

3. education: over the years our education system has been left behind and there is no real effort being made to bring it up to speed with the rest of the world’s standards. we have digressed and we are only focused on rewriting history instead of focusing on computer science, logic, art and the sciences. our education system is rigged to be nothing more than an extractive exercise that engineers transfer of wealth from the middle and upper middle classes to the oligarchy. 

the chinese and americans have advanced ten steps beyond us. my kids will not study in indian schools. 


4. healthcare: expensive, riddled with fraudulent practices and 0 regard for human life. and don’t even get me started with insurance and how much of a scam it is in india with the world’s highest rejection rate of 50%+

the government does not provide free healthcare nor does it seem bothered to regulate insurance companies in order to provide some relief to the middle and upper middle classes. 

and again, healthcare is also owned by the political oligarchy who want to simply use this as a means to loot the people. 

5. law &amp; order: this is an absolute joke in this country and the whole vip culture erodes my faith in the system. add to it instances of judges being caught red handed and yet not being impeached shows that the entire political economy of the country is complicit in taking us all for a ride. our values and ethics have long been buried 6 feet under. 

6. communalism: india’s social fabric has always been its weakest link. given the diversity of our cultures, languages and religion we need an inclusive and open society. in the last 10 years we have regressed into everything that is the opposite of that. 

our discourse is dominated by religion, caste, language and everything that divides us. while the politicians loot us, we are all distracted by this nonsense. 

at the end of it all, we pay through our noses in taxes and put up with unnecessary vip attitude of every low level government official and uneducated goon who has become a politician. 

i am saying goodbye to this country and moving away as i believe that there is no nation building exercise that is taking place here and we are simply deluded if we think differently. 

i’m out of this shithole and off to live my good life. would recommend that you all do the same if you have the means. 

if you are able to and you don’t, just remember that your kids and their kids will suffer the brunt of your inaction."
reddit,2025-04-26 12:56:23,"gensol steals the money and public sector lenders hold the bag the short story is that gensol is a solar energy company which borrowed money from a couple of public sector lenders and did not pay them back. the lenders expected gensol to use the borrowed money to buy electric cars for its business, but gensol preferred shuffling the money around and buying expensive real estate and embarrassing looking chocolates \[1\] instead.

people first realised something was shady last month when gensol’s credit rating agency, icra, [downgraded](https://www.icra.in/rationale/showrationalereport?id=133471) it and said that the company lied about repaying its loans and even fudged some documents. gensol being a listed company, sebi was on this and last week [released an order](https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/apr-2025/interim-order-in-the-matter-of-gensol-engineering-limited_93458.html) against gensol and its founders. some fine choice of words there:

&gt;what has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in gensol, a listed company. the promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. the company’s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the company’s funds were promoters’ piggybank.

anmol singh jaggi and puneet singh jaggi, the founders of gensol, stole money from pfc and ireda, two public sector nbfcs focused on lending to companies in the energy space. can they expect to get their money back?

# do loans or do shares, don’t do both

pfc and ireda lent ₹664 crore ($77 million) to gensol to buy electric cars. gensol was supposed to chip in an additional ₹166 crore ($19 million) and buy the cars with the combined ₹830 crore.

gensol *did* buy the cars, but it only spent some ₹568 crore ($66 million). it completely skipped putting up its own money and it also left out about ₹96 crore ($11 million) from the money pfc/ireda lent it. that money, or at least part of that money, is what got spent on dlf’s luxury flat, golf gear, vacations, chocolates, and the rest of the good stuff.

now this was a secured loan. secured by electric cars, of course. pfc/ireda can, theoretically, take over those cars and sell them off to get some of their money back. they’re [considering](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/pfc-ireda-mull-sale-of-gensol-evs-to-secure-loans/articleshow/120463025.cms?from=mdr) doing that—but it’s not going to be trivial!

the cars aren’t with gensol to begin with. they’re leased to blusmart, another company owned by gensol’s founders. i mean, they might not even physically be with blusmart at the moment, the company [shut operations](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/blusmart-begins-pullback-of-ride-hailing-operations/articleshow/120340973.cms?from=mdr) overnight. the cars will be with blusmart’s drivers in different parts of the country, in different shapes and forms. the lenders will have to first get blusmart to retrieve those cars, and then seize them from blusmart itself. yeah, it’s going to be a while.

whenever pfc/ireda manage to herd all the cars back, cars being a depreciating asset, they’re going to lose money on the sale. the cars were originally worth ₹568 crore, and they’ll be between 2–4 years old. optimistically they’ll get back maybe 60–70% of that? of course, they lent ₹664 crore in all, and they’ll have to spend on the entire recovery operations, valuations, auctions, etc. *and* let’s not even get into the lost interest income. they’ll be lucky to get back half of what they lent out.

apart from the cars, ireda has gensol stock as collateral. from sebi’s order:

&gt;we have been informed by ireda vide email dated april 11, 2025 that promoters have created pledges for 75.74 lakh shares of gensol. further, the latest pledge invocation data available on the bse website, indicates that more pledges have been invoked during this month. this would lead to the possible conclusion that promoter shareholding in gensol would become even lower, may be negligible, if ireda were to invoke the pledge created by anmol singh jaggi and puneet singh jaggi.

gensol has about 3.8 crore shares in all. twenty percent of those shares, owned by the jaggis, were pledged as collateral to ireda. but gensol’s share price has been tanking for the last 2 months now, and it looks like the company’s going to be worth zero or close to zero, very soon.

i know i have the luxury of hindsight as i say this, but the choice of gensol’s shares as collateral is a little unusual? when someone’s shares are pledged, it’s because they have borrowed money using their own shares as collateral. in this case, the loan ireda made wasn’t to the jaggis, it was to gensol itself. and yet the jaggis’ shares were pledged as collateral.

i get why ireda would’ve liked to have some pledged shares. listed shares are nice and convenient. you know what they’re worth, there’s no need to auction them, no need to go to court to seize them. if you’ve lent someone money against shares and they ditch paying you back, you can open your laptop, login to your brokerage account, find and click the “invoke pledge” button on their website, and the shares are yours. \[2\]

but ireda lent to gensol and then turned around and took gensol’s shares as collateral! \[3\] if you’re a lender it would be nice to ensure that your collateral doesn’t get obliterated if your borrower decides to not repay. i am sympathetic. gensol is supposed to be a solar energy company, not an electric car-leasing company. ireda was lending to it for a side-biz, and it presumably did some calculations and figured that even if the electric car business flopped, the solar energy business would be enough to give the company’s shares its value. apparently not!

# regulatory affairs all right

gensol bought its electric cars from a company called [go auto](http://goauto.in/), and it was this company that enabled the jaggis’ fraud. gensol would pay go auto for cars (apparently), but go auto would turn around and transfer this money back to a company either owned directly by the jaggis or someone related to them.

there is a weird possibility for pfc/ireda. gensol, on the face of it, did buy cars worth ₹568 crore. but that’s what gensol reported with go auto on the other side of the trade. i wouldn’t be surprised if this figure itself happens to be inflated and the lenders realise the real market price for the cars was even lower. \[4\]

one of the companies that go auto transferred the money that gensol paid it to was called wellray solar industries. from sebi’s order:

&gt;subsequently, on the same day (february 01, 2023) rs. 54.62 crore was transferred to go-auto (bank a/c no. 06792000003065 with hdfc bank). before this transaction, go-auto’s account had a balance of rs. 4.86 crore. on the very next day (february 02, 2023), go-auto transferred rs. 40 crore to the bank account of wellray (a/c no. 058605002357 with icici bank), which had a balance of rs. 4.93 lakh before the receipt

\[…\]

&gt;presently, almost the entire shareholding (99%) of wellray is held by lalit solanki, who was employed as regulatory affairs manager at the gensol group until december 2018, as per information available on linkedin.

the jaggis trusted a former employee enough to transfer ₹40 crore ($4.6 million) to a shell company entirely in his name! imagine if he had run off with it.

this former employee, lalit solanki, used to be a *regulatory affairs manager* at gensol. is it just me or is there something humorously ironic about using your *regulatory affairs* guy to defraud lenders?

i grew up in a lower-middle-class home, lived in a small town, and was always on rent. i thought i’d be able to afford a house once i got a job.

i did land a good job—but the housing market is absurd.

even with a better-than-average job, i don’t think i can afford a decent house for my parents unless i commit to being an emi slave for 20+ years. i really wish my parents had bought a home before 2000, when property wasn’t this overvalued.

here are my observations:

- there's no real demand-supply logic—builders operate like a cartel and refuse to lower prices.

- most builders are politically backed, which is why there’s no single pan-india builder. political parties need black money, and real estate is the easiest way to park it. the builder gets black money from politicians, develops a locality, and then returns the money in white. real estate has become a bank for black money. builders have no urgency to sell, so they keep prices artificially high.

- nearly all property sellers demand a significant portion of the payment in cash. as someone with a private job, how am i supposed to come up with that kind of unaccounted cash?

- property prices are absurd. in india, real estate costs are often 50x the median salary in major cities. in comparison, it's just 5–6 times in cities like london or dubai.

- contrary to popular belief, real estate—especially residential—is usually a poor investment (unless it’s commercial property). rental yields are typically below 4%. so why are people buying like crazy? the answer: black money. if someone has, say, 100 crores in black money, the easiest way to hide it is in real estate. they don’t need to sell quickly and can just wait for years until a desperate buyer comes along. with no urgency, they never have to sell at a loss.

- india has enough land to house everyone. in fact, we only need about 5% of the country’s land to provide a modest home for each person. but due to poor governance, towns and villages lack basic infrastructure—water, electricity, jobs—forcing people to migrate to cities and driving prices even higher. in a land-scarce place like singapore, high prices make sense. but india has more than enough land.



the govt gives free houses to poor,  free electricity/water to farmers, free land to companies like tcs , but people like me who don't have a house and yet pays lacs of rs in tax everyyear don't get a dime in return."
reddit,2025-04-26 21:24:45,"colive is harassing me and asking for more money. please help me (skip to the second para) colive plano, jaynagar, bangalore. the room i was assigned, room no. 328 (there was a murder in that room before my stay and it was not disclosed. which i think is illeagal) it did not have a functioning ac, which i specifically chose and paid a premium for. the place smells like cigarette smoke every other day and have seen multiple bottles of beer and other alcoholoc drinks lying around. there's also this weird smell i would get while in the washroom, i don't know what it was, but it smelled terrible, i used to hate to go the washroom for that exact reason, maybe from other rooms as all rooms' in a vertical line of every floor washrooms were connected to the same exhaust. fights too broke out every month there, which severely disrupted my sleep and focus in my studies. water supply was never stable and having hot water at the time that they mentioned was a blessing. even the electricity was cut frequently as they wouldn't pay the electricity bill to bescom. the workers wouldn't clean as they weren't piad their already minimal salaries on time and just in the duration i stayed there (about 3 and a half months), the cleaning staff was changed 3 times. also the managers were the irresponsible people i've ever known, except the first manager (there were 3 or 4 managers during my stay alone, don't remember exactly if it was 3 or 4), who was a quite a good guy, but had to leave as the other guests were verbally abusing him and making fun of him, due to a mistake caused by the app and not him, he too was under paid. now it's been long time since i left that hell hole (about 7 months) but i'm still receiving messages on whatsapp about incomplete dues, like what? seriously? it's been 7 months! they're harassing me with them telling that they'll take 'legal action' against me if i do not repay them.  

like they're asking ₹39,650, but for what? they say it's for out standing rent (₹28,327), which i dont know why they're charging me, as i never stayed there for that month, electricity charge (₹6,205), which they said is waived off, as a compensation for the before mentioned non-functional ac and they've seem to changed their mind and are now charging for it, separation charge (₹6,348), like what even is separation charge? and  finally notice period charges (₹19,680) and what is that for? i did exactly what the then manager told me to do, so what notice charge should i pay? i was never told by any of the managers about this notice charge, when i had asked the manager about the process of leaving, he told that i should just inform him and i can leave, just the same as what the previous manager did, when i had asked him, as i was planning to leave that place anyways. so the total  amount is now ₹60,560 of which ₹21,000  is waived off, which was my deposit amount. now i've been told to pay ₹39,560. seriously, i will have to escalate this harasment to the legal authorities. 
please never stay at any colive property, as they're always poorly maintained and keep harassing their customers. 
we have called multiple times on the given number, but no one picks up, they keep harassing me with such messages, i will reach the consumer court if required."
reddit,2025-04-27 11:26:30,"my two cents on attack and its causes 
my thoughts and questions regarding attack

1) intelligence quality - what went wrong with our intelligence? did we monitor wrong areas? or is government chain of command ignoring the local intelligence and foreign intelligence? has our quality of intelligence gone low? 

2) cost cutting - in the name of cost cutting , we are cutting corners in wrong areas like number of armed forces  , quality intelligence , quality military equipments like drones but using the same fund for political campaigns , funding states for political appeasement and freebees. for example , it is very hard for me to believe that there were absolutely no cctv anywhere at a major high security area of attack . if it was china or usa , we would have ai enabled cameras all over such places . instead we have government blaming tourist guides that they went to a closed tourists place .

3)  local government - i know they have nothing to do with security of j &amp; k . but can we trust them ?  for example , wb mamta is known to import bangladeshi immigrants to skew voter base . this introduces large terrorists risk inside country .is high time we have center rule in both j &amp; k and wb? 

4) demography - j &amp; k muslims hate india rule over them . they definitely feel that hindus are buying lands and business and their fear is soon in decades they will become minority and might be pushed out from their land . should government do something about it to give more priorities to local population and limit outsiders from buying property? 

5) political appeasement - both parties are utilising hindu vs  muslim agenda just to be in power without actually doing anything for welfare of people . is this an another get rich scam of uneducated rowdies (politicians i mean) that working population is falling for “ you are not safe without us protecting you “ narratives? seems like entire mo of leaders of pakistani , india and bangladesh to stay in power.

reddit,2025-04-29 10:50:36,"what has the government done for you? we all pay taxes—whether rich or poor. income tax, gst on groceries, luxury taxes, property tax, vehicle tax… practically everything we do is taxed. yet, we’ve accepted corruption as part of the system, shrugging it off with, ""yeh chalta hai."" security? basic facilities? forget it. but the next time we see narendra modi, rahul gandhi, or any politician, we’ll fold our hands and greet them like they’ve revolutionized our lives. **are we really this naive?**

let’s do a simple exercise. whether you live in a village, town, or metro, think about your local area (10-20 km radius). **compare the last 15-20 years and ask:**

1. **roads:** are they better, or still riddled with potholes?
2. **water:** availability? quality? still relying on tankers or borewells?
3. **air quality:** has it improved, or is breathing harder now?
4. **medical facilities:** any new hospitals? or are people still traveling miles for treatment?
5. **education:** are government schools/colleges functional, or just crumbling buildings?
6. **cleanliness:** is your area cleaner, or drowning in garbage?
7. **life-changing improvements:** list 5 major upgrades in your area. can you even name one?

for me? nothing has changed. only **worsened.**

**here’s the real kicker:**

\- you get a job? government demands taxes like they’ve earned it for you.

\- you get laid off? no support, no unemployment benefits, no laws protecting you.

\- employer doesn’t pay salaries for months? government stays silent.

\- you get another job? tax cycle restarts. **zero accountability, full entitlement.**

**here’s my reality (and why this system is a scam):**

i was an employee at **brane enterprises**—a company founded by **ramalinga raju** (yes, the satyam scamster who **looted ₹10,000+ crores** and is still living like a king).

* over 10 months of unpaid salaries.
* 95% employees laid off over 6 months.
* thousands of families financially destroyed.
* government’s response? silence.

but guess what? the same government will happily demand taxes the second any of us find another job. no accountability for the rich, no safety net for the rest of us.

this isn’t just my story—it’s the story of millions. the **satyam scam, pmc bank, byju’s**… the list never ends. we fund this system with our taxes, yet we get nothing but exploitation in return.

this is the story of millions—even the **""brightest minds""** of india. we fund this system, yet we’ve stopped demanding better.

**question: what’s the breaking point? when do we stop applauding politicians and start holding them accountable?**

reddit,2025-04-30 01:05:12,"my questions to general public of india (as a pakistani) hey, so i have some questions regarding the pahalgam attack, and i thought reddit is the best place because on instagram people just reply with abuse instead of actual responses.

1. if you really believe that pakistan is involved, then why make the lives of indian muslims difficult? i have seen videos of people beating a 70+ year old man over this issue, breaking the shop of a muslim boy, and many more incidents. the problem is, usually, other indians condemn such things saying education is important, but now, for some reason, everyone is supporting it.
their a video of indian women who live in karachi  and due to this issue,she had to return to india and crying because she has 2 small babies but atleast comments were generous and their a video of man requesting indian government to let him stay for his son treatment but people in comments saying karma like wtf(their was mixed opinions but ratio was bad)


2. why is it so hard for you guys to blame your government, intelligence, and army? you are saying that terrorists sneak through lakhs of trained soldiers, many checkposts, and still, if someone questions it, they are called pakistani or terrorist. why? you may know about the balochistan incident recently, and our army said india aided those terrorists, but people still blamed the army, asking how they failed to stop it.


3. the indian media is so, so, so manipulative. i have a dish antenna at home, so i was watching indian channels. they were saying “pakistan is scared,” “there’s an atmosphere of fear in the conference,” etc., but if you watch the conference yourself, you’ll see that even politicians were laughing and enjoying like the public on memes—because it’s obvious that it’s impossible to defeat any nuclear country. yes, you can do airstrikes, but you can’t completely take over. also, they’re showing that “all of pakistan is drowning.” i literally live in jhelum and the water level isn’t even that high. the areas shown flooded in videos—that’s normal and even happens in the monsoon season. how do you people get manipulated by this? even western people don’t believe in news channels anymore.


4. there’s no proof that pakistan is involved in it. if the government had it, they could just take it to the un and put pakistan in the grey or black list. and if for a second we believe that pakistan is involved, then it’s your intelligence’s fault that terrorists or resources sneaked through lakhs of soldiers and checkposts and you weren’t able to capture them. believe it or not, but there’s a chance of modi's involvement. it’s all about dirty politics to make hindus and muslims fight and increase vote banks. same case in the 2014 blast, 2019 pulwama, and now.


5. if people were killed in balochistan, that’s not terrorism but a freedom fight.
if it happens in gaza, it’s war and everything is fair.
if it happens in ukraine, there’s full support to russia.
but if the same thing happens in india, then it’s terrorism. why is this? are the lives of people in gaza, ukraine, or balochistan worth less than the people who died in pahalgam?



at last, i condemn any loss of innocent life regardless of any situation. may allah curse those who did such things. this conversation is at a public level, so i hope you reply with proper answers instead of cussing, as i tried my best to not make it biased (except point 4).the post doesnt represent every indian."
reddit,2025-05-03 16:48:30,"the single most important indicator of a country’s progress should be the quality and affordability of healthcare available to its citizens. most people on the internet in general, let alone reddit, are typically young, between the ages of 15 and 30. because of the natural health that people in this age range usually enjoy, they often tend to take the importance of medical facilities for granted.

one can brag about a million things when it comes to their country. but unless the country can provide top-quality medical treatment at affordable rates, it’s all pointless.

a vast majority of people—and when i say vast, i truly mean well over 95% of the population—are just one medical bill away from poverty or bankruptcy. even if you earn ₹5 lakhs a month, one serious hospital visit is enough to make you realize you’re not as financially secure as you thought.

when a loved one is seriously ill, their health becomes the only thing that matters. at that moment, it won’t matter what the country’s gdp is, whether everyone is using electric vehicles or digital payments, or if a bullet train runs at the speed of light. what will truly matter is the quality and affordability of medical treatment.

india, being highly competitive in academics, has produced many excellent doctors. on one hand, hospitals like apollo etc give me a sense of relief - they represent high standards in medical care, cleanliness, and service. but on the other hand, the sheer cost of treatment fills me with dread at the thought of needing prolonged care for someone i love. truth is that very few people could actually afford treatment at such hospitals.

if you’ve ever visited a government hospital, you’d know it’s not a place you’d wish even on your worst enemy.

whether someone recovers with treatment is never entirely in the hands of doctors - every soul will eventually taste death, regardless of access to the best medical professionals or facilities.

but the ability to provide your loved ones with the best possible treatment when they needed it, just the thought that they are being treated by best doctors and have have best medical facilities available to them - that alone can free you from a lifetime of resentment and guilt.

i realized it very recently when i had to take my sister to hospital and get some tests done. the tests alone cost me close to 1l.  i wonder how many people have to just sit back and pray that whatever ailment they or their loved ones have, just goes away by the grace of god. this is also probably the reason why babas and mystics who offer unique way of healing the sick are so popular in india."

my father is in dubai, he said come as helper here (near 2000 aed) like papa intension is not like he will do the job as helper in electrical or some other profession he said to me like a lot of engineer come here as helper and after some time he get the good job what he has done in india but here also he is not agreeing for this.

most of the time, he says things like: “**mera dimaag kamzor hai**” or “**mera dimaag chalta hi nahi hai**” (my brain doesn’t work / i’m mentally weak). and to be honest, this has become his excuse for everything.

we try not to pressure him too much because we’re scared he might take it negatively or do something to harm himself. he’s not lazy, but he lacks confidence, gets distracted easily, and has no clear direction or consistency. he doesn’t even apply to jobs regularly.

as his younger sibling, i’m doing my best. i was selected for gsoc in my 2nd year, and right now i’m also doing lfx at some cncf project. i’m learning, building projects, improving my resume — but i still feel helpless when i see him stuck like this.

i just want to help him get his confidence and career back before it’s too late. i don’t know what to say or do anymore. if i talk too honestly, i fear it might hurt him. but staying silent also doesn’t help.

for people who like to go in depth:

to anyone coming to bangalore for work and looking for pgs to stay. please do yourself a favour and stay away from stanza. it's a nightmare living there. here are the reasons why: 

the rooms are incredibly small with rents soaring to 16k per month not including water, electricity and lunch. rent may be more depending on the block you take or if you have a balcony facing a building or natural sun. 

food quality is a joke. often delayed. cutlery barely available. we once had water with yellow food coloring suspended in it for ""dal"".

electricity goes out every other day, generators are used sparingly. hot nights with no fan. hours during day time having trouble with charging laptop. 

there used to be washing machines but they have taken that out. replaced it with a paid service. have to fill out google forms each time to do laundry. who knows what happens with your clothes so ladies please think thrice before you give your clothes

water is an everyday problem. every morning you wake up to no water, they arrange 2 bathrooms for over a 100 people to use.... that's worse than public bathrooms. 

wifi. never works. have to always rely on mobile data. 105gb limit with speeds slower than your grandma trying to walk up stairs. will ask you to disable random mac. i'm not a cybersecurity expert but i think there's a reason we don't share personal device's mac address. 

previous point was about relying on mobile data, that is if you are fortunate enough to get a room where you have network. jio users forget even getting calls. you are doomed 

you can forget everything getting your deposit back, my roommate had to threaten with an fir and only then he got his deposit back. 

any amazon,myntra etc parcels are not kept responsibly. the guards simply do not give a fuck. every week there's someone whose parcel goes missing.

the fridges are not maintained. big fault on residents on this, there are items months beyond expiry date in the fridge. 

the garage of q block has a leakage problem which floods the floor with sewage water. this happened 6months ago and still hasn't been fixed despite multiple complaints. the rcs have been changed thrice but no action has been taken regarding the problem itself 

the staff aren't paid on time either. doesn't affect you but it shows the reality of the situation. 1 block has 6 floors with around 10 rooms in each floor and 2 people sharing a block. that's 120 people each paying around 17k a month.... i wonder where all that money goes

i wish i could post screenshots to prove i'm not just another disgruntled resident who is just angry about something and making shit up.... please let me know where i can post my proof as well"
reddit,2025-05-07 23:37:59,"society parking - hunger games edition so here’s a little gem from the circus i call “my housing society.”

we live on rent in a society that has less parking space than a mumbai local at peak hours. naturally, when we moved in, we asked the society manager where we could park our bike. his very helpful answer? “park wherever you find space.” cool, thanks — i’ll just levitate it into my balcony then?

anyway, we tried to park in a couple of places and kept getting told “not here” and “not there” — because apparently, “wherever you find space” is code for “good luck figuring it out, sucker.”

eventually, we found this peaceful, unmarked little spot near the watchman’s bathroom — no board, no drama. or so we thought.

cut to today: some guy comes up to us while we’re parking and says we can’t park there either. why? because apparently, we once used his car parking space to reach our spot. not parked in it. not camped in it. just crossed through it once because the other path was blocked.

we explained it was a one-time thing, but no — man pulls out cctv footage like he’s running cid from his balcony. “don’t ever step in my parking again,” he says, as if his parking space is sacred ground and we’re defiling it with our dirty two-wheeler tires.

i swear, i didn’t know people had so much free time to rewind cctv just to catch someone walking through their precious concrete square. maybe i’ll start reviewing the footage too — see who’s breathing my air or looking at my bike funny.

meanwhile, the society has zero clue where tenants are supposed to park. but hey, as long as we don’t accidentally hover over someone’s parking spot, we’re good, right?

anyone else dealing with this brand of nonsense? how do you survive the passive-aggressive parking wars?

p.s. – words are from chatgpt, but the frustration is 100% real.

tl;dr:
society has no proper parking, manager told us to “park anywhere,” but everyone has an issue with everywhere. we found a quiet spot, but a resident pulled cctv footage of us crossing his parking space once and told us never to do it again. no parking, no rules — just cctv-fueled power trips."

reddit,2025-05-11 00:50:12,"non-military options: imf vote, fatf push, and indus water control form india’s new strategy india is rightly deploying other measures also to make pakistan pay for its cross-border transgressions.

india on friday abstained from voting on a fresh loan tranche to pakistan of $1.3 billion, after raising serious concerns over the efficacy of international monetary fund programmes for a country with a “poor track record”.  last year india had asked the fund to place caveats that such loans are not used by a sponsor of terror  for arms purchases. due to a stressed balance of payments situation, pakistan secured a $7 billion bailout programme from the fund last year and was granted a $1.3 billion climate resilience loan in march. this outreach not just to the imf but also the world bank and asian development bank constitute an important element of non-military options being exercised by india to make pakistan pay for its cross-border transgressions of april 22. there are no prizes for guessing whether the imf would heed india’s red-flagging funding to pakistan. this was admitted as much by india’s foreign secretary, vikram misri, when he stated at a press conference that “the decisions of the board are a different matter. but i think the case with regard to pakistan should be self-evident to those people who generously open their pockets to bail out this country.”

this non-military option of curtailing international funding for pakistan is clearly intended to bring its economy its knees. pakistan’s economy depends on an imf bailout. the country has repeatedly sought help from this agency. in fact, there have been 25 arrangements since it became a member in 1950. the ongoing $7 billion package consists of six reviews over the span of the bailout and the fresh loan tranche is contingent on a performance review. that was at stake in yesterday’s board meeting. any curtailment of funding will deal a body blow to its economy that is just stabilising. growth of 2.7% is likely in 2024-25 (july to june). inflation has dropped. debt is stabilising. all of this is going to come under stress due to the ongoing hostilities which will erode its foreign exchange buffers for essential imports. india is also working towards bringing pakistan back into the ‘grey list’ of the financial action task force, the global money laundering and terror financing watchdog. pakistan exited the list in 2022 but a re-listing would sharply constrain its access to international financing.

however, the most consequential non-military option that can devastate pakistan is our suspension of the 65-year old indus water treaty that awarded the use of three western rivers, the indus, chenab and jhelum to pakistan while three eastern rivers, the ravi, sutlej and beas were given to india. this treaty has so far miraculously survived through three wars and perennial political tensions between the two neighbours. pakistan depends on these western rivers for 80 % of its agricultural output and a third of its electricity generation. india is not obliged now to share data that is vital for flood, irrigation and hydropower planning. any sudden release of temporarily withheld water from dams can lead to floods downstream in pakistan. india has curtailed the flow of water through the baglihar dam on the chenab and is planning similar measures on the kishanganga dam along the jhelum. islamabad has warned new delhi that any moves to restrict its waters to be “an act of war”. that war has already begun and is being currently waged by india also exercising non-military options."

hello everyone,

i have acquired a fully constructed four-story house in chandigarh, featuring a basement and three floors. the plaster of paris (pop) has been completed, and i am currently installing a comprehensive network comprising cat6 ethernet, cctv, mesh wi-fi, and fiber.

while the installation of wires between floors is facilitated by the presence of a lift duct and vertical shafts, horizontal wiring across rooms on the same floor poses a challenge due to the potential damage it could cause to the walls or the pop. consequently, i have decided to route all wires directly from the basement, even if this necessitates multiple wires per room.

i would appreciate any final suggestions, product recommendations, and ideas to optimize this setup while minimizing the need for future rewiring.

1. my goals:

- comprehensive gigabit+ ethernet wiring (cat6) throughout all rooms
- seamless mesh wi-fi connectivity across all floors with ethernet backhaul
- hybrid poe + wi-fi camera system, preferably without chinese cloud servers
- support for a wide range of devices, including smart tvs, gaming consoles, printers, intercoms, audio systems, hdmi-over-lan, nas, servers, and iot devices
- optional fiber backbone for future 10gbps or isp failover
- clean and concealed installation, eliminating exposed wires and conduits

2. wiring philosophy:

- all cat6 cables will originate from the basement
- no horizontal wiring between rooms on the same floor
- vertical wiring is feasible (via lift duct or shafts)
- even for switches installed on each floor, wiring will originate from the basement
- plan for approximately 20+ cat6 points per floor, resulting in a total of ~80–90 points
roof and basement:
- roof and basement will receive 2-3 points each for the installation of cameras, mesh, or future use.

mesh wi-fi plan:
- the plan will utilize the tp-link deco mesh system.
- x75 cameras will be placed on the ground and the first floor.
- x50 cameras will be installed in the basement.
- x55 cameras will be placed on the second floor.
- additional tapo bee or x20 devices may be installed on the roof or edges to enhance coverage.
- ethernet backhaul will be established from each deco node to the basement, rather than from node to node.
- all deco nodes will be connected independently from basement switches.

cctv setup:
- the plan aims to install approximately 20-25 cameras.
- a combination of poe ip cameras and tapo wi-fi cameras will be utilized, with ethernet backhaul for connectivity.
- brands with chinese servers, such as hikvision, dahua, and ezviz, will be avoided to prioritize privacy-friendly or local-server-based camera solutions.
- cat6 cables will be utilized to connect all poe cameras directly from the basement.

devices and features over cat6:
- cat6 wiring will be employed for the following devices and services:
    - high-speed internet with ethernet backhaul
    - gaming consoles, pcs, smart tvs
    - printers (ethernet or wi-fi via wired backhaul)
    - nas/server systems
    - ip intercoms
    - multi-room audio systems
    - hdmi over cat6 extenders (for remote display or projector use)
    - future poe devices (iot, access control, smart lighting hubs)

fiber optic plan (optional but considered):
- the plan will involve running fiber optic cable from the following locations:
    - isp entry point at the street to the basement (main router/switch location)
    - roof to each floor to facilitate future 10g networking.
summary:

this document outlines the comprehensive setup plan for a long-term wired network. it encompasses the primary and secondary isp connections, as well as the implementation of failover connectivity to multiple networks. the network infrastructure will utilize fiber optic cables routed through the same lift shaft or vertical conduit.

recommended products and brands:

- cables: d-link cat6 (with consideration for shielded cables when run alongside electrical conduits)
- switches: tp-link or d-link (for poe-enabled cameras and non-poe-enabled rooms)
- cameras: tp-link tapo (for wi-fi cameras)
- wi-fi: tp-link deco with ethernet backhaul (excluding wireless uplinks)

concerns and constraints:

- pop work is completed, precluding room-to-room wiring on any floor.
- one switch per floor is planned, with all wiring extending back to the basement.
- daisy-chain switching and sharing backhauls between rooms are not feasible.
- electrical conduits may be necessary in exceptional cases; in such instances, shielded cat6 (stp) is recommended.

final questions and suggestions:

- are there any lesser-known yet beneficial devices that should be wired for immediate implementation?
- are there any lessons learned from your own setup that i should consider?
- is hdmi-over-cat6 a reliable solution for 4k media transmission over extended distances?
- is it feasible to safely share poe and data devices on the same floor switch?
- are there any alternative wired backhaul options available given the current restrictions on wall openings?
- are there any skilled technicians in chandigarh who possess expertise in poe, structured cabling, and mesh wi-fi?

this setup is intended for long-term use, and i am eager to ensure that all essential devices are properly wired. if there are any opportunities to optimize, expedite, simplify, or enhance the setup, i would welcome any insights and recommendations.

i extend my gratitude to anyone who has experienced similar setup challenges and can provide guidance and support."
reddit,2025-05-17 17:08:59,"why don’t neglected constituencies demand better civic services from their elected leaders? i’ve been thinking about a pattern that’s hard to ignore, especially when you live in or visit different parts of the same city. in one area, you see smooth roads, daily garbage collection, streetlights, and well-planned infrastructure. then you travel just a few kilometers and enter a neighborhood that’s majority muslim or dalit—and suddenly, it’s a completely different world.

in many of these areas, the roads were laid 30–40 years ago and haven’t been touched since. empty plots are used as dumping grounds. trash is everywhere. municipal services like garbage pickup or sewage maintenance are barely functional or totally absent. and these aren’t remote villages—though i understand rural india has its own set of challenges. these are urban neighborhoods, in the same city, under the same municipal administration.

what i genuinely don’t understand is why the people living in these neglected areas don’t demand better from their elected leaders—mlas, mps, corporators. these leaders get elected repeatedly, but basic amenities don’t improve. meanwhile, other localities—often wealthier or with higher levels of education—are clearly being prioritized and maintained.

is this just systemic neglect of marginalized communities? or is there a deeper issue—like a lack of civic awareness, mistrust in governance, or simply having no expectation that anything will ever change?

i’m not blaming anyone. i’m trying to understand: why is there so little visible pressure from the ground up in these neglected urban areas? if both parts of the same city are voting, paying taxes, and living under the same administration, why such drastic inequality?

why aren’t these basic rights being demanded as aggressively as they should be? is it that these communities feel their votes don’t matter, or are they being misled by empty promises?

would love to hear thoughts from people who’ve lived this reality or have insights into how this works politically or socially.

⸻

tldr:
in many indian cities, muslim- and dalit-majority areas have poor infrastructure and lack basic services even decades after roads were first laid. meanwhile, nearby areas are well-maintained. why don’t residents of the neglected areas hold their elected leaders accountable for these conditions?

this post was generated with the help of ai to better organize and express the ideas clearly, but the thoughts and concerns are genuine."
reddit,2025-05-17 17:34:42,"why is it always the citizen's fault? this will be a big rant, so anyone who aint got the time, please feel free to scroll away. let me write the comment you will write for you as well, """"i ain't reading allat i'm happy for you or sorry that happened""



every time something goes wrong in this country, the narrative is the same tired script: *“citizens need to be more responsible.”*

  
a dangerous dam area keeps claiming lives due to strong currents or high winds? but instead of installing barricades, guards, or warning systems, the only response is: ""look at our generation taking photos there"" *“people shouldn’t go there.”* why is the burden of survival placed entirely on citizens while the government refuses to secure high-risk zones?

this same hypocrisy plays out across every aspect of governance.

  
take all cleanliness drives or swacch bharat, what was once pitched as a cleanliness revolution is now reduced to everyone on internet just moral policing, *""what kind of folks these are"" ""so much dirty"" “don’t spit! don’t litter!”* meanwhile, municipal workers still sweep roads with brooms straight out of actual ancient bharat where folks were speaking ~~sanskrit~~  prakrit. 



mechanized sweepers? vacuum trucks? modern sanitation systems? still missing. dust is simply pushed from one side of the road to the other until the monsoon comes and wets it out, if the rains arrive at all.



and rivers, often called sacred, are almost gutters everywhere, choking on industrial waste and chemical runoff. but the blame? it always falls on individuals: *“stop throwing plastic!”* as if the real problem is of one folk throwing a wrapper and not unchecked factory dumping, corrupt municipal bodies, and zero enforcement of environmental regulations. (take london doing the clean the city instead of moral policing about stop spitting tobacco drive, i cant remeber it accurately\_

the truth? the government doesn’t want to fix things. it wants **scapegoats**.

  
it’s easier to shame citizens and youth, and let them fight amongst themselves, than invest in solutions. easier to moralize than modernize. easier to launch another slogan-driven “pledge” than procure a single functioning garbage truck.



and then there’s women’s safety.  
yes, men should be better. but why does the conversation stop there? why aren’t we talking about dark, unlit streets? defunct or missing cctv cameras? the lack of trauma-sensitive policing? why are justice systems so slow, and why are fast-track courts just pr stunts?

every time a sexual assault case makes the news, social media explodes with calls to “raise better sons” and critique men’s behaviour online. definitely valid, but why is all of that just for a weekend trend? why hasn't any one of these actually gone on to blame the governement and force them to write strict laws? a woman gets brutally raped and she is only paid a measle amount? make the rapists pay crores to the girl and the family and hang them, if there is no law no policing, no coverage, no fear why will any of them stop? why must women rely on apps, pepper spray?

and then there’s this new wave of language chauvinism in every other state, “speak our language or go back!” as if it isnt politicians who stirred this rhetoric in the first place. yet the public shaming always targets individuals who parrot what their leaders said.

crime isn’t just about “bad people.” it’s about poverty, repression, unemployment, hopelessness. it is folks whom you make content on the internet for but will never reach to them because they are so bottom on the line they probably dont have decent phones, and the society and economy has crumbled them so much they are forced to commit a crime. but instead of tackling those root causes, we’re told: *“obey the law!”* as if laws mean anything without food, dignity, or opportunity.

and the ultimate gaslight 

*""indians lack awareness!""*  
if that’s true, where are the public libraries? why are thousands of students still forced to study in underfunded schools with rote learning and no critical thinking? drama and arts are “important,” they say, but there’s no state support to make them viable careers. books are locked away in libraries so dysfunctional they might as well be ruins. i remember going to library 2 decades ago, but libraries are practically ancient history now, i had a library in mumbai university too, but it was easier saving from a building caught on fire than actually finding a book there, forget book i did not even know who is at the reception.

and yes the efforts by ngo's and individuals who are doing plantation drives, cleaning beaches, etc matter. but a hundred volunteers cannot fix what **decades of systemic neglect** have broken.

we’re told “stay safe during floods” while cities drown every monsoon because the drainage systems haven’t been updated since british came here. why the hell are drainage systems in the middle of the road and not besides?

especially not when crores are collected in taxes and **still** garbage disposal is left to ngos, roads are literal death traps, and every basic service is diy.



we follow rules. we vote. we pay taxes.  
and yet, **we’re the ones constantly told to “be better.”** be more aware. be more patient. be more resilient.

there are millions of cases of cyber crimes, specific areas where kidnapping and robberies happen but the solution to them is a whatsapp forward saying ""toh doston friends, yaha pe aisa hota hai , this really happens here, aur ye button dabake ye hojayega so be careful when pressing this button"", the police know exactly where all these crimes happen, they know who did it too but they will never address them. hell i lost an iphone, i submitted an fir and everything and after months i tracked it down myself to gujarat and the cops were like, ""ab gujarat kon jayega aapke phone ke liye"" and shooed me off.



when is the state going to do its job?

this isn’t just exhausting—it’s manipulative.  
blame is constantly redirected to the public, so the system can keep failing while pretending to stand with us.

it’s disturbing how normalized it is for citizens to carry the burden of structural collapse. we pay taxes. we follow rules. we vote. and yet, we’re the ones expected to be extra-vigilant, super-informed, endlessly patient, and magically self-sufficient in a system that fails us over and over again."

reddit,2025-05-21 22:02:49,"is india moving towards a one-party system? the recent elections in delhi, haryana, and maharashtra delivered a strong message: the bjp is becoming more and more dominant, while regional parties are collapsing. india's political environment is drastically shifting due to an aggressive central administration, leadership problems within regional parties, and a divided opposition. however, does this indicate stability or the gradual death of multi-party democracy? india has been growing as a diversified federal democracy for many years, and regional parties have been essential in addressing local concerns. but these parties are being politically crushed or dissolved today.

**is there an intentional strategy to destroy opposing forces in an organized manner, or is this just the way politics work?**

# a closer look at bjp's expanding grip:

**1) maharashtra**: bjp manipulated the split of both shiv sena and ncp, destroying its rivals from within; eknath shinde and ajit pawar, once bjp opponents, are now bjp allies, raising the question: is bjp winning elections or absorbing its opposition?

**2) haryana:** once a battleground for regional giants like inld and jjp, the state is now firmly under bjp’s control; jjp, a key player in 2019, has been reduced to irrelevance, while congress is still in ruins; the opposition in haryana is not just weak, but is being rendered obsolete.

**3) delhi:** after ten years in power, the aap government was subject to constant legal, political, and administrative attacks. kejriwal and other top aap officials were involved in corruption investigations, so the bjp took advantage of the chaos to weaken the aap's stronghold on the vote. however, was this a systematic defeat or a fair battle?

# does india's opposition seem to be dying?

**1. the bjp's political engineering?** by kidnapping opposition parties' leaders, cutting off their finances, and undermining their influence, the party has mastered the art of separating and weakening them.

**2. a complete guide on power?** the bjp is gradually eliminating rivals rather than defeating them in elections by using defections, judicial cases, and administrative control over state machinery.

**3. destruction by institutions?** there are serious concerns about the fairness of democracy when central agencies (including the ed, cbi, and it) target opposition leaders on a regular basis.

**4. a silent court system and media?** due to an unfair playing field created by conventional media and judicial delays in politically sensitive matters, many critics claim that the bjp has unchecked power.

**what happens when one party gains too much power? if checks and balances are maintained, a strong party does not always imply a threat to democracy. however, the issue remains the same: do such checks and balances still exist in india today?**"

mohak only has options because he's got millions of followers. what happens to smaller creators when another big org pulls this shit? they just get extorted quietly because they can't mobilize an army or get media attention

sure mohak's using his influence to pressure ministers which feels sketchy, and yeah if your whole video revolves around one clip then fair use gets complicated. but at least he can fight back

ani demanding 50 lakh for 10 seconds of speech is insane but they know most creators will just pay up or delete their content rather than fight. threatening to nuke entire channels instead of just striking videos? that's the real problem - youtube lets them do this

i’m an it professional currently based in bangalore. while the city offers great opportunities, a solid tech ecosystem, and vibrant social life, the **infrastructure (especially roads and traffic)** is honestly wearing me down. i live around **marathahalli/whitefield**, and commuting has become a major source of stress — potholes, traffic jams, unpredictable travel times, etc.

i'm considering **hyderabad** as an alternative. i’ve heard it has:

* better roads and city planning
* less traffic congestion
* cheaper cost of living
* rapidly growing tech sector (google, amazon, microsoft, etc.)

at the same time, bangalore is still the biggest it hub in india, with arguably more job options and a stronger startup ecosystem. another huge plus is bangalore's weather (i'd rather stand in traffic in a pleasant weather).

* anyone living in **hyderabad** — how’s the work culture, commute, and overall life quality?
* folks in **marathahalli/whitefield** — are you thinking of moving too, or do you think bangalore is still the best bet?

reddit,2025-06-02 21:34:43,"went to bali. came back with ptsd from indian civic sense i have always been a firm believer that india is a treasure trove for travel. from mountains to beaches, deserts to rainforests, we have it all; history, culture, diversity. i’ve always judged people who rushed to explore other countries while ignoring the beauty that exists in our own. i thought, why not explore all of india first before going abroad? that was, until i took my first international trip to bali recently.

it was a bit of an eye-opener.

bali is very similar to india in many ways. the culture, the landscape, even the chaos of scooters and tourists. but what stood out to me was how much more enjoyable the experience was. the main reason wasn’t geography or infrastructure, but civic sense.

i sat on random benches, ate food at beach shacks, walked around freely and all without worrying about hygiene, litter, or uncomfortable stares. no pan masala stains on the pavements, no chip packets flying around, no continuous honking on the roads. it genuinely broke my heart a little.

even the roads, while not luxurious or perfect but were clean. in india, walking on footpaths feels like a game of hopscotch, avoiding paan stains and random puddles of who-knows-what. you’re constantly watching your step instead of enjoying your surroundings.

and it’s not like bali is some super rich country but the people seem to respect public spaces, and that makes all the difference.

even more disappointing! i saw indian tourists in bali throwing garbage in the sea when there was a dustbin barely 2 meters away. cutting queues while boarding ferries. being loud and disrespectful. it hit me that these are the same things i’ve been tolerating in india for years, thinking it’s just how things are.

but why is it like this?
why do we honk at red lights as if it makes them turn green faster?
why do we spit on roads and throw trash outside our car windows?
why does basic decency take a backseat, even among the so-called “educated” and well-off?

honestly, it’s getting harder for me to enjoy even a weekend outing in my city now. the irritation begins long before i reach the destination. the honking, the aggression, the filth, the general lack of respect for public space and each other. it chips away at my peace of mind.

i used to think the next generation would be better, but seeing my own colleagues who are very well paid, educated people, litter without a second thought makes me wonder if this will ever change. i do call it out, but they shrug it off like it’s no big deal.

i love india. i want to stay here and see it get better. but it hurts to admit that sometimes, it feels like we don’t deserve the beautiful country we have.

would love to hear your thoughts. have you felt something similar either after traveling abroad or just in your day-to-day life here?

one common misconception is that black spots or lines on a mango mean it’s bad. this isn’t true in most cases. those black marks usually come from the sap that leaks out naturally when the mango is picked. it dries on the skin and might look odd, but it’s completely normal. the fruit inside is often perfectly ripe and delicious. yes, there are times when black spots are due to fungal infections like anthracnose, but even then, you can usually just cut out the affected part and eat the rest without a problem.



now coming to the actual market pricing in local apmc markets mangoes are graded and sold to traders or “veparis” who decide their fate. mangoes with a lot of black spots the lowest quality sell for about ₹600–₹800 per 20kg box. these mostly go to juice and pulp factories. slightly better looking ones still not very attractive go for ₹800–₹1100 and are often used for frozen mango products or canned mangoes.



then you have mangoes in the ₹1100–₹1300 range which are the lower-quality ones sold for eating. they aren’t necessarily bad but their quality depends heavily on the farmer. if the farmer hasn’t gone overboard with pesticides or water these can be decent.



now comes the real deal mangoes that sell between ₹1300–₹1900 per 20kg. these are the ones with slight dullness on the skin, a few black lines, but the taste is genuinely amazing. if the farmer knows what he’s doing these are as good as it gets. my own house mangoes usually fall in the ₹1500–₹2000 range during peak season. they might have some marks on the skin but their taste, texture and ripeness are top-tier. occasionally, you’ll get one or two perfect-looking ones with no black lines at all and that’s when you know the farmer really got it right.



above that, you have mangoes sold for ₹2000–₹2400 per 20kg which are usually meant for export to countries like the us or australia. but here’s the catch the export process kills the taste. to meet international safety standards, these mangoes are boiled, freeze-shocked and then passed through radiation tests. as a result, they might look flawless but the taste ends up flat, watery and sometimes even unpleasant.



to make mangoes look export-ready, some farmers go a step further. they use a high-pressure sprayer mixed with diluted car wash or cleaning chemicals to wash off sap and give the mangoes an artificial shine. if done once it’s usually fine. but when done excessively it damages the fruit’s natural skin layer and can be harmful. this is common among large scale exporters because only shiny mangoes pass visual checks for export. unfortunately, it’s all about appearance not taste or nutrition.



another thing don’t blindly trust big farmers. many of them use heavy chemicals and even things like car shampoo to shine their mangoes. if you want genuinely good mangoes, go to mid or small scale farmers. they’re more likely to care about the quality and taste over appearance. some farmers wrap mangoes with orange plastic or foam caps while they’re still growing on the tree. the goal is to prevent any dust, insects or natural marks from touching the skin so the mango looks spotless and shiny. while it works for appearance it actually kills the taste. when you block all natural elements like sunlight, breeze and even the occasional harmless insect contact the mango doesn’t ripen the way it should. these covered mangoes often end up looking perfect but tasting flat with less aroma and sweetness. it’s another example of choosing looks over flavor and that trade off is never worth it if you care about real mango taste.



now let’s talk about the kesar mangoes specifically from south gujarat. if you want the best-tasting kesar, look for mangoes grown in navsari or valsad districts. but not all parts of these districts produce the same quality. the east side has rocky, mountainous soil, and the west side is closer to the coast. in both cases, water availability is lower, which actually leads to better mangoes denser, more fibrous, less watery, and packed with flavor. these aren’t super sweet but are incredibly balanced and rich in taste.



that said the middle region where i’m from is often underrated. it tends to get slightly more water and if the farmer over-irrigates, the mangoes can become watery. but if the farmer manages it well, even the middle region can produce mangoes that rival the best. they’re a bit juicier but still carry that signature kesar flavor. the farmer’s skill makes all the difference here.



lastly, i got a bit sidetracked, but this rant started when i saw blinkit selling 500g of kesar for ₹100 that’s ₹4000 for 20kg. are people seriously buying at that price? when farm-fresh mangoes in peak season go for ₹1500–₹2000, that markup feels insane.



so let me know how much did you paid for yours."

reddit,2025-06-07 01:55:30,"why is having maids so normalized in indian households compared to western countries? something that has always made me curious is how common it is for indian households to rely on maids. whether it’s for cleaning utensils, sweeping and mopping, or even cooking food, many indian families, even middle-class ones, hire maids for daily tasks.

is it because we are too lazy to do it ourselves? or is it that our work-life balance is so off that we just don’t have the time? either way, it feels like having maids has become a cultural default.

in western countries, yes, people do hire cleaners or housekeepers, but it’s far less frequent and usually only by wealthier families. in contrast, in india, even households with limited income often have maids coming in daily. why is that?

of course, affordability plays a big role. the cost of hiring maids in india is low, and there’s a large supply of domestic workers. but i feel like there’s more to the story than just economics.

in the west, people are more self-reliant when it comes to household work. fixing small electrical issues, plumbing problems, assembling furniture, cleaning the house thoroughly — these are things many people just know how to do. that self-reliance also seems to translate into more respect for those professions, because they understand what the work actually involves.

here in india, i’ve seen people blatantly bargain with electricians, plumbers, and especially maids, even when the difference is just 100 rupees — something that might not matter much to them but could mean a lot to the worker. is this lack of respect because we haven’t done these tasks ourselves and don’t understand the value of the labor?

is this cultural? economic? a mix of both? would love to hear how others see this situation.

edit: p.s it was my opinion and would love to have an open discussion to understand more about this topic.

all views are appreciated to have a better understanding.

have a nice day!"
reddit,2025-06-07 11:10:12,"i got scammed by nobroker for 19k: lessons learnt that i want to share hi to all nodes of the network,  
i write this so that my experience, although painful to me, may bring awareness and benefit to others.

in short, the lessons i draw are thus,  
\* do not trust anything that nobroker executives say over call

\* tell them to send the details of the flat/property over mail

\* take every promise over mail or in any other written format. everything else is a marketing gimmick

the complete story:

* i took the nobroker relax tenant for plan (\~4k) in january 2025 (ironic, since this plan only gave me stress)
* was shown a property in cv raman nagar but it was on a rooftop and there was something off about it
* after the property visit, the nobroker rm (relationship manager) asked me if wanted the property for rent, i refused saying i had concerns if the construction was legal (i was clear about my requirements i wanted a legal construction with a legal address, with previous electricity bills for government purposes)
* as soon as i had expressed my concerns about the flat's legality, i got a slew of calls from various nobroker executives (i will not take their names here because i don't want to blame an individual and i believe the work culture and pressure at nobroker must be fault) trying to convince me that the flat is legal, it a has an address and assured me that the owner would share previous months' electricity bills too
* i told them i don't want to proceed without even knowing the actual flat number of the property (i vaguely remember when i visited the flat that i did not spot a flat number on the door)
* one rm from nobroker lied to me over call and gave me some fake flat number. he assured me that ""nobroker is a big brand"", that he has been in the company for long and that they verify every property and that ""every call is recorded""
* i was convinced by his smooth talk. i thought worst case the call has been recorded, and i can just point to the call if things go south (boy, was i wrong)
* so, to proceed i had to pay an advance of 15k (7k to nb, 8k to the owner). i did so. (i should have bought a ticket to nepal, in hindsight, and run to the mountains)
* when the owner then shared the rent agreement with me, he had mentioned a flat number which was completely different from what the nobroker rm had told me. i realized something was deeply wrong
* i visited the society and asked the security guard himself if such a flat exists. he smiled. i realized all the flat numbers in the society had three digits. the flat number given to me was 4 digits. it was an illegal construction on the terrace of the apartment which was being pushed off as a flat. i felt like a complete idiot
* i asked the owner about this, as soon as he saw my whatsapp message he deleted the rent agreement (image attached). i still have a copy of the draft rent agreement though
* i tried calling the various rms about the lies. at first, they said they shall look into the issue. then they stopped picking up my phone calls
* i talked to the nobroker customer support multiple times. i even told them to check their recorded calls.
* nobroker told me: no calls between nobroker and me happened on that day and thus they have no records. this was so ridiculous it was funny! if no calls had happened, then how did the deal get closed?
* i realized it was an exercise in futility to approach nobroker.
* i am considering my options now which include ejagriti or the consumer court but honestly because of personal commitments i do not know how to settle this issue without long court battles. i tried the national consumer helpline but they advised to me to go the consumer court.

however, what this experience has taught me is not trust the word of an exec but take every communication in mail.  
thanks for your attention and may your day go well.  
\[alas, i realize i cannot attach images in this thread\]

update:

big thanks to you guys and the power of reddit, i was recently contacted by nobroker and they agreed to refund a partial amount, 7k, (the nobroker executive was able to identify the case with this reddit post and i was literally told on call this is regarding your complaint post on reddit). all those calls and follow-ups were futile but one post on reddit galvanized them into action. apparently, it still is going to be a struggle to fetch the complete amount (12k remains) back and i have to see what my further options would be but reddit made a powerful impact.   
  
**make no mistake i am still deeply disappointed by nobroker** and would **not** recommend it to anyone, but i wanted to express my thanks to this community. community expression and support can really be a powerful thing. to all those who texted me via chat, thank you for your support and sorry for not replying but i cannot seem to access the chat \[""unable to join the room""\]. 

new lessons learnt,

\* any community needs platforms for expression of voices to be heard

\* consumers supporting other consumers is a force multiplier

\* if follow-ups, mails, calls fail, approach such a platform to raise awareness and you might be rewarded with something too :)"

tldr:

india’s global reputation has plunged: outsiders increasingly lump it with pakistan and bangladesh, rather than as a rising economic or technological power.

a complacent, inward-looking leadership and a sycophantic “godi media” bubble have created a hallucinatory domestic narrative about india’s “massive” economy and vishwaguru status.

pakistan, by contrast, has punched above its weight by communicating more effectively with western media—india’s recent multiparty pr tour only underlines its own failings on the world stage.

once lauded in the 2000s as a tech-savvy “rising asia” alongside china, india now scarcely features in global discussions on trade, soft power or research—especially in cutting-edge fields like ai.

the gap between india’s self-image at home and the sober reality abroad is now so wide that it constitutes either a tragic denial or a grotesque comedy."

someone on the comment section was also talking about how ""we are ruining british culture"" by bringing in a rikshah for a day, and having a model dance on it which again, isn't necessarily taking away from their culture. another even said ""it's not african american it's either african or american"" again taking jabs at the black population in america (which were brought in through slavery with no choice of their own) to promote white nationalist talking points. i'm not sure what this man said it in response to. i've even heard others promote this notion that we're r-word babies, and just pure garbage. 

personally, i've been into hindu gods and goddesses for a long time. and from my own personal experience, i've had an indian guy tell me that modi is going to take over bangladesh. anyways, i'm not here to spread hatred. all i'm trying to say is that, yes my country's politics is one where people are highly polarized. it's just a consequence of events and as such, there's going to be people choosing india or pakistan and you'll see the manifestation of it. 

but there's also plenty of level-headed individuals that don't want to sabatoge the relationship with india and actually remember our liberation war as a historical symbol of our freedom. i think and i'll say this as a message: if you guys want to fight bangladeshis and pakistanis (them too), please use logic, and spread awareness. this degrading that many of you partake in as if we're sub human (i think nowadays you guys do  it more to bangladeshis because i think pakistanis are deemed attractive), is not right and will radicalize even those that would've heard your case/cause. 

a message to west bengalis: i understand that many of you want to be represented and also feel like you want to saperate from us due to the recent events, but going to people's platforms and commenting bangladeshi; not bengali is not it. because at the end of the day, we're bengali too -that is our ethnicity.

“we’ll build a park, start a digital library, and soon start it jobs right from the village!”

reddit,2025-06-16 21:56:06,"current state of india worries me. religious identity politics is a major issue for voting constituencies in india because the population very much votes along demographic identity lines as opposed to the work a politician has done or is set to do. religion is one of the most prominent cleavages along which politicians oftentimes pander and sway the vote, making promises they may never keep while playing the long game of voting that creates further sociopolitical rifts down the road. to vote for someone based on their religion—when that person is not promising social change based upon that religion—is to vote in the wrong direction. it complicates the relationship with leaders who may not provide service projects, development projects, or humanitarian efforts because they think their support is already secured through comorbidity and affiliation as opposed to refugee existence.

this harms the nation over time by promoting communal strife, social dissatisfaction, and a non-nation building mentality. when people vote for someone because they're of the same faith, it fractures potential chemistry as opposed to a streamlined, collaborative, and growth-based instant gratification. thus, politicians don't even have to bother with developmental initiatives. they already got the vote. therefore, this weakens democracy and economic development and prevents the nation from properly solving its most pressing problems."

reddit,2025-06-18 11:06:09,"does hindi unite or divide india? a reality check ! **let's look at history which shows u what happens when a certain policy takes place**

# pre-2024 (before nep 2020 push):

india, despite its diversity, remained largely united.

yes, there were internal state disputes (e.g., tamil nadu vs karnataka over cauvery), but these were isolated bilateral issues, not pan-regional unrest.

importantly, southern states like tamil nadu, kerala, karnataka, telangana, and maharashtra may have differed politically, but they did not display a collective resistance against the centre over anything big.

the overall national atmosphere was one of diversity and unity.

# post-2024 (nep 2020 implementation phase):

the push for hindi-centric education and administration under nep 2020 triggered strong, coordinated opposition from southern states.

the emphasis on hindi was perceived as:

a cultural imposition, a threat to regional languages and federal autonomy.

&gt;*^(for the first time in decades, multiple southern states found a common cause to resist the centre — not over water, not over finance, but over language identity.)*

let's look at states and their reaction when hindi was pushed one way or the other

# tamil nadu

1937 – compulsory hindi in schools--rajaji’s congress govt introduced compulsory hindi in madras presidency schools.

protests led by periyar &amp; the justice party. early dravidian mobilization. a strong messaging on “tamil self-respect” was started and set the ideological foundation for future anti-hindi movements.

1965 – official language act implementation -- centre’s move to make hindi the sole official language (replacing english).

protests erupted, massive, violent agitations by students &amp; public across tamil nadu, **with many sacrificing their lives.** “*hindi theriyathu poda*” — “*i don’t know hindi, get lost*” became a cultural resistance symbol.

this eventually led to constitutional amendment; english retained as associate official language.

# karnataka

2017 – namma metro signage controversy--hindi signs in bengaluru metro alongside kannada &amp; english citizens launched #nammametrohindibeda (no hindi in our metro) campaign and hindi signage was removed.

# west bengal

2018–2023 – central exams, nep push; hindi dominance in upsc, central education bodies, and nep 2020. strong political and intellectual opposition was triggered. cm mamata banerjee said “we have no problem with hindi, but don’t impose it. bengal reiterated its stand on bengali-first education &amp; governance.

# north-east states

2020–2022 – nep 2020 push--nep 2020 push to introduce hindi in schools and administrative roles. no public agitations but instead, governments officially requested exemption. demonstrating passive resistance and continued preference for english &amp; native tribal languages.

# maharashtra

ongoing – cultural and media space due to hindi dominance in media, film industry, and central hiring. raj thackeray (mns) and others have launched campaigns demanding marathi priority.“marathi mansa first” – “marathi people come first.” growing movement to protect marathi in public spaces and employment against hindi

# punjab

1950s–present – post-partition linguistic assertion, resistance to hindi being treated as default indian identity after partition. political movements emphasizing punjabi language rights. punjabi retained as official language, strong assertion in education &amp; administration.

# history speaks louder than slogans.

every time hindi has been pushed, india has seen resistance — sometimes silent, sometimes violent. from tamil nadu’s mass protests in 1965 to civil disobedience in karnataka and passive objections from the north-east, the pattern is clear:

***imposition breeds division and hatred***

but when hindi is not forced, indian states have remained **united, cooperative, and supportive** of the centre.

&gt;***from independence till today, india has stood strong without a common language, now india is divided because we push for a common language***

people often say, “*one language will unite us.*” but history tells another story:

&gt;***it is only when hindi is pushed that india fractures.***

so perhaps the truth is this:

&gt;***hindi doesn’t unite us — it divides us. and those who push it, knowingly or unknowingly, divide india. jai hind !***

i’m a super specialist doctor currently pursuing fellowship abroad.
it’s a 1 year contract and in the beginning it was really hard.

of course i missed india and its convinience. missed the food and post 9 pm markets and crowds on streets. how spoiled we are with house help and cooks and delivery apps
coming from mumbai not seeing a soul on street after 7 pm made me feel lonely. 

me and hubby drove a truck and moved our furniture ( including couch , beds ,  fridge and washing machine) , did gardening and mowed the lawn here . no bhaiya ji came to install the electronics or deliver the furniture.
we used to crib about how easy life is back home. 
at work place things were tough as well.
it took us months to convince people that we are talented and deserving.
these guys don’t trust our health system and doctors.
subtle racism is real as well

but then things settled down, we settled in . 
i work 40 hours a week and get better respect and pay.
india we worked 70 hrs a week . i would go to work before kids wake up and they would stay with the maid and it’s their bedtime by the time i would come back . here i spend weekends with my kids .

at least no patient/ relatives can come and beat the hell out of me .
or make me feel guilty for charging consultation fee!
in india people pay more for pvr movie tickets than they do as doctor fees 


i can take kids  to big ass parks with swings, the air is clean (aqi 4)
the water is pure and we drink from taps 
roads don’t have potholes 
people drive in lanes 
no honking ( seriously it’s been 6 months and haven’t heard a honk) 
health care is free for citizens and pr 
child care is subsidised 
no water clogging after rains
no building collapse 
no falling of passengers from local trains 
no deaths cuz a hoarding fell 
no hit and run 
no drink and drive 
pedestrians have the highest priority on roads 
people cycle to work and go to the beach at the end of the day to see the sunset.

having said that 
why is india not clean ? we are the oldest civilisation!!!!
why are there no public amenities (parks, public toilets etc)
why don’t people in india have civic sense? 
why is the traffic so bad ?
why is women safety taken for granted  ( rapes, molestation is so common) 
when will people stop fighting over religion and ask the govt and authorities to develop the country ? 
when will there be law and order ??

i was an indian govt supporter before i moved but now i realise how we are fooled by sold media !!
we and our government have a very bad international reputation
 
nothing has changed in the last 10 years except of religious divide and glammed up gunda gardi 
immigration is all time high 
all talented doctor, engineer, lawyers , scientists leave the country and work in international organisation cuz india is going downhill day by day . 
we are the 4 th biggest economy but 41% wealth is with 1%

1. no clean water
2. no electricity 
3. lack of roads and transport

i have noticed quite few necessary things overlooked in many of villages in india.

there is no source of clean water. we have one of the biggest dams nearby but all water goes to city and what village people get is muddy unfiltered water. during monsoon the water quality is so bad that one can’t even wash feet let alone drink that water. the water supply is restricted during summer season and gets disrupted often and it won’t be restored in next few days. 

the electricity situation is not the best either. there is often power outage or fluctuations. during summer the supply is cut with the title “we are taking measures so there wont be issues during monsoon” which is a joke. the power is out twice a week from 10-6 always. if it rains even a bit there wont be power supply for at least 1 day and you can imagine the situation in proper heavy rains. 

and lastly the roads. there is almost no proper road structure remaining. i assume mostly due to the corrupt politicians. the recent road created by one of them got cracks within 2 weeks. 

its not like people in village are paying less for anything. they pay same for electricity as city people. people like me pay the same amount of tax but without these basic amenities. i understand the revenue generated by villages is far less than city but there is not even clean water. 

government say we are developing but when we look into ground reality i do not see any difference in past 20 years at all. whereas i have never experienced major power outage in any cities i have lived in. 24x7 water, waste management. i agree transport is not good but its far better compared to villages. 

our major population leaves in rural areas which are always overlook. i am not sure when people will get basic things without much hassle in rural areas. 


p.s: i have lived most of my life in a village and still continue. i admire the clean air, fresh vegetables but i see that getting down very soon."

reddit,2025-06-22 14:26:22,"went to ajmer for peace… came back full of anger i recently went to ajmer, thinking it would be a peaceful and spiritual trip. i mainly went to visit the dargah of khwaja garib nawaz, and while the place itself is beautiful, my overall experience was honestly terrible — mostly because of how people there behaved.

right from the start, the locals were rude. i asked someone for a small help, nothing big, and he replied so badly, like he didn’t even want to talk. i thought maybe it was just one person. but no — this rude behavior was common. almost every other person had the same attitude.

in just two days, i saw people fighting in the streets multiple times — shouting, abusing, ready to hit each other over small things. there was no peace, no calm. the whole atmosphere felt full of tension. i came with a good intention, just to visit a holy place, but i felt like an outsider. not welcomed at all.

and honestly, the cleanliness and hygiene were also very bad. roads were dirty, garbage was lying around everywhere, and public areas smelled bad. even near the dargah, where you'd expect more care, the surroundings were not clean. it didn’t feel like a holy or respectful environment at all.

here are some examples:

i went to buy a small pocket bag from one shop. the price felt too high, so i said, “sorry, i don’t want it.” the shopkeeper rudely replied, “if you can’t buy a pocket, just carry money in your hand.” i didn’t even argue because i was not in my city.

then, i went to buy attar (perfume) from another shop. my sister was also there, and she looked at some other items placed nearby. the shopkeeper straight up said, “first decide what you want and from whom, then come to the shop. otherwise, don’t enter.” i was shocked.

another bad experience: my family bought some clothes from a shop. the seller had packed used clothes and was selling them as new. when we went to return one item, he refused and started arguing instead of helping. seriously?


no one had patience. no one showed basic respect. it honestly felt like they didn’t want outsiders in their city. and all this made me so uncomfortable, angry, and sad.

ajmer may be famous, and the dargah is truly spiritual. but what’s the point if the people around make you feel unwelcome — and the city itself feels so unhygienic and messy?

that whole trip got spoiled for me.

reddit,2025-06-22 20:27:48,"india semiconductor mission is a political gimmick with no gains close to 80k crore will be spent and 6 plants have already been approved. but, anyone with a bit of knowledge about semiconductor industry will know that it has already gone wrong. out of 6, just one - the tata plant in dholera is an actual fab - the place where silicon is converted into a chip. all the rest 5 are just osats ( outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing). 

just looking at the figures which have been wasted at these osat plant angers me. 22k crore micron plant (11k crore given by govt) is an absolutely garbage. osats don't need much skill, is mostly labour intensive and has low profit margins. india will not be able to gain any intellectual property, forget developing one. it's going the same way as the service based it industry of india - a source of cheap labour for world without any ip.

you can build a state of the art power electronics fab with 22k crore , which india does not have any. making 3 actual frontend fabs with 80k would have been far more beneficial for india than 5 packaging plants. the thing which completely ends this mission is the fact that skills, workforce and supply chain needed for a frontend fab and packaging plants are completely different. these osats will never grow into real fabs. also, there are no display, sensor, power electronics and led fabs in proposal. they would still be 100% imported.

i wonder who advices govt? those corrupt ias babus know nothing in this world apart from a bundle of cash.

but why is this a political win? since more people can be directly employed here, they can show it in numbers. they are low risk industries, so less chance of failure. also, a layman will say ""waah modiji waah"" without realising the details within . 

my purpose of this post is to tell people not to blindly follow news and conmans like ashwini vaishnav. ism does not make bharat ""atamnirbhar"" in any way."

my parents just visited the temple yesterday as we live in blr they booked a bus for 3k and it showed as special darshan. the bus left at 8:30 from blr and reached the temple by 2:30.
they were asked to leave for the temple by 3 in the night so that they can get in the line by 5 am
 
part 2
they entered the gates and were asked to submit the phones and other belongings.no water bottles were allowed(later this becomes a big mistake)and after that they entered a waiting hall of 2k ppl.
part 3
now this is where the problem starts they had to wait in that hall for about 6 hours and even after that they were asked to wait longer after taking 1 full round and cam back to the same place.

the hall and other places have all the facilities but their maintenance is a menace for a temple of this stature the hygiene levels are nasty. we are always taught to be at are cleanest near temples and other holy places but the situation there was horrible.

there were sources of ro water but people were using that same water for all purposes due to which it was impossible for my parents to drink from a place where people are using that water for all activities.

there was food and other refreshments served but that caused an even bigger issue as that led people to take them in such large ammounts and whatever was being left over was being thrown on the same ground you are standing in 

part 4
my father after seeing the situation tried call the emergency number from the phone available but there was no response. vendors were selling tetrapacks and other refreshments but they were also being consumed at such a rate bcz u cant imagine staying in a hall with no entry or exit with 2k ppl arround you and in such bad cleanliness.
(as my mom stated it felt like a jail).

part 5
in the end they had to book a hotel and go back and did the darshan on the next day morning.

i was really taken aback and sad that this is the status of one of the worlds richest temple and i had visited the same a long time ago my dad did state that the amenities have increases but there is no maintenance.

as such a holy place in our culture with such significance i would really like the situation to change.

if anyone else has visited in recent time please do share your experience."

reddit,2025-06-25 09:15:24,"june 26, 1975 emergency: 50 years later, are we safe from another one? the following excerpt is drawn from ***india: the definitive history*** by professor damodar r. sardesai, an esteemed indian-american historian and professor emeritus of history at ucla, who passed away in 2016. renowned for his authoritative works on south and southeast asian history, including *southeast asia: past and present*, sardesai held prestigious roles such as chair of ucla’s history department and the first doshi chair in pre-modern indian history. this passage, detailing the emergency declared on june 26, 1975, under indira gandhi’s leadership, examines the economic crises, political unrest, and judicial challenges that led to the suspension of fundamental rights, offering a critical perspective on this pivotal moment in india’s democratic history.

**citation**: sardesai, d. r. *india: the definitive history*. routledge, 2018, pp. 343–348.

**the emergency**

the huge costs of maintaining an estimated 10 million refugees from east pakistan, who crossed the border into india’s west bengal, and the costs of the bangladesh war and for maintaining the 93,000 prisoners of war as prescribed by the relevant geneva conventions grossly affected india’s economic situation. additionally, the two years following that war were marked by crop failures affecting the price levels of essential commodities. internationally, the world oil prices tripled following the egypt-israel war in 1973, affecting the costs of industrial products, again adversely affecting the cost of living. for the masses, the pride and glory of winning the bangladesh war and partitioning pakistan gave way to the frustration of balancing the pocketbook in trying to meet the family’s expenses. there were numerous strikes, the worst being that of the railroad employees.

*discontent and j. p.’s total revolution*

the public discontent over the spiraling inflation, unemployment, and mounting corruption was channeled in two states—bihar and gujarat—into mass movements. in the latter state, students led the agitation and forced the congress-led government to resign in 1974. in the following year, the congress party was trounced at the polls in gujarat in june, and the opposition parties came together to form a government there. in both the states, the activists took inspiration and guidance from jaiprakash narayan, popularly known as j. p., the nationally known gandhian sarvodaya leader who led the public discontent and advocated a civil disobedience movement, reminding people of the gandhian movement by that name against the alien, colonial british regime four decades before. if the bangladesh war had raised indira’s personal stature to unprecedented levels, j. p.’s movement, called the total revolution, made indira and her acolytes run for succor. the movement influenced the defeat of her party in the gujarat elections in june 1975 as a multiparty coalition, the janata morcha (people’s march) party, won the majority of seats in the state assembly.

*allahabad court judgment against indira’s electoral violations*

the final straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back came in the form of a writ issued by justice j. m. l. sinha of the allahabad high court on june 12, 1975, declaring indira’s election to the parliament in 1971 invalid on the grounds that she had violated the election rules. she had appointed as her election agent one yashpal kapoor, who was during part of that period on the government payroll in the pmo. she had also benefited from the up state government’s free construction of a speakers’ rostrum and free electricity supply to her public address system during her election campaign. the judgment concerned a case filed by her opponent in that election, raj narain of the samajwadi socialist party. indira’s infractions were petty, but the representation of the people act demanded that all violations, small or large, not only rendered the offender’s election invalid but would also make the individual ineligible to hold public office for six years. two chief ministers of states and a member of indira’s cabinet had previously been sanctioned in the same manner. justice sinha gave the congress parliamentary party twenty days to elect a new leader for the position of the country’s prime minister.

it was the first bad news for indira and her party on june 12. that evening came the news of the congress party’s defeat in the gujarat state elections, where out of 182 seats, her party had won only 75. the congress party appealed to the supreme court of india for an “absolute and unconditional” stay order against the allahabad high court judgment. it was a tribute to the indian judicial system that on june 24, 1975, justice v. r. krishna iyer of the supreme court, going strictly by the letter of the law, denied a stay order, thereby closing all legal options for indira, who was then expected to resign. on the same day, at a massive rally in delhi, the opposition parties under j. p.’s leadership announced that they would launch a civil disobedience movement throughout the country if indira continued as prime minister. j. p. went further and appealed to the army and the police not to obey any illegal orders even if they were issued by the prime minister.

*proclamation of “emergency”*

should indira have resigned? if she had, it was most likely that the congress party would have picked as her successor a weak and pliable person, who in his or her capacity as prime minister, could be depended on to recommend to the president that he set aside the allahabad high court judgment and pardon her. but feeling insecure, the indira gandhi government issued an ordinance in the early hours of the fateful june 26, 1975 (after waking up president fakhruddin ahmed to obtain his signature), declaring a national emergency under the provisions of part 18 of the constitution. the ordinance said that “a grave emergency exists whereby the security of india is threatened by internal disturbances,” justifying the suspension of fundamental rights. using her majority in the parliament, indira proceeded to amend the constitution, exonerating her from all culpability. in predawn raids across the country, some 676 members of the opposition parties, including 59 members of the parliament and including the venerable j. p. and political leaders of stature who had rendered long-term public service such as morarji desai, were arrested under the hated maintenance of internal security act (misa), without the benefit of habeas corpus or a court trial. women leaders such as the maharani of jaipur, rajmata of gwalior, and mrinal gore were closeted in the same wards as some mentally deranged criminals, whose shrieks and cries would not allow them to sleep. as for j. p., he contracted renal disease while in detention and had no access to dialysis. most of the right-wing rashtriya swayamsevak sangh and jan sangh (later bharatiya janata party \[bjp\]) members, including the future prime minister atal bihari vajpayee, were jailed. within a week of the ordinance, on july 4, twenty-six political organizations, including the rss, were declared illegal.

indira’s emergency government also imposed a strict censorship of the press and the media. on the day of the massive arrests of opposition leaders, the supply of electricity to all major newspapers in the capital was cut off so that they would not be able to publish the news of the arrests. the press protested for days by leaving the editorial space blank, sometimes bordered black. even the mildest criticism was not permitted by the censors. newspapers that even subtly criticized government actions were denied government advertising, which was and is an important revenue source for indian newspapers. several journalists managed to smuggle bits of information to the foreign press, which regularly reported indira’s excesses and the constitutional amendments that had lent legality to her ignoble actions.

indira then proceeded to “legalize” her own position in the context of the allahabad high court judgment. thus, at her behest, the parliament adopted the thirty-ninth amendment to the constitution in august 1975, placing elections to certain positions—president, vice president, prime minister, and speaker of the lok sabha—beyond challenge in a court of law and also beyond the pale of judicial review. the amendment, retroactive in its application, nullified the allahabad high court judgment. as if this was not enough, the allahabad judgment was submitted to the supreme court, which ruled on november 7, 1975, that the judgment be “set aside.”

it was widely reported that in imposing a national emergency, indira acted on the advice of her younger son, sanjay. he was also her principal adviser throughout the period of the emergency, which lasted nineteen months, from june 25, 1975, to january 18, 1977. even while nehru was the country’s prime minister, indira had to approach him if something could be done to help sanjay, who had been arrested by the police for reportedly being involved with an automobile-stealing gang in delhi. while in great britain as an apprentice at roll-royce, he was arrested for fast driving and other demeanors; he had to be bailed out by the indian high commission. over the years, he had built a reputation for behaving as if he was above the law. during the emergency, he came to be known for “getting things done” in the public interest and also for personal favors to well-placed businessmen and industrialists, securing them permits and additional quotas in return for funds for the party. there was no knowing whether he drew a line between the funds meant for the party and for his own expenses. he had expensive habits, including flying, which, according to parliamentary records, cost fuel charges of 3,600 rupees a day. both sons, sanjay and rajiv, lived with their wives and children (sanjay had one son, rajiv had two children—a son and a daughter) with the prime minister. there were wide rumors that sanjay’s financial affairs were carried out with his mother’s knowledge, and perhaps some substantial amounts were transferred to swiss bank accounts.

sanjay’s most notorious campaigns during the emergency rule included forcible vasectomies as a means of family planning on those who lived in delhi slums and the eviction of an estimated 700,000 squatters and slum dwellers from their huts, which were summarily destroyed. some of those who resisted near the turkman gate were shot dead. incidents of this kind were repeated elsewhere, particularly in indira gandhi’s home state of uttar pradesh, where, according to the economist of london on december 4, 1976, in twenty-one such incidents, police opened fire and killed 467 people to make room for some beautification projects. vasectomy was forced on men even in their seventies and eighties. riders in buses were ordered to come out and were sterilized in makeshift tents. there was tremendous panic created by these drives not just among the people immediately affected. others wondered, “when will this reign of terror stop?”

sanjay soon became a law unto himself. he made and unmade chief ministers and announced major policy decisions in the name of his mother, without consulting with the cabinet minister concerned. a feeling spread among members of the congress that indira was preparing for a dynastic succession of her son sanjay, who had used the emergency period to organize the youth congress on a large scale with himself as its supreme leader. the government-owned radio and television gave sanjay tremendous exposure, lauding his various campaigns, subtly hailing him as the future leader. a wisecrack was, after the end of the emergency, to describe the emergency period as “one and a half person’s rule.” he did not specify whether indira was the one or the half!

indira, however, was not happy with the emergency and the criticism, particularly in the foreign media, leveled at her. one such criticism concerned the extension of the life of the lok sabha by one year, which the constitution allowed but had never been done before and has not been done since. a number of western leaders and their ambassadors in new delhi used every opportunity to convey to indira most tactfully that it would be best to restore democracy. perhaps bowing to such pressures and possibly because she herself believed she could not rule indefinitely without a public mandate, on january 18, 1977, indira surprised everyone in india and abroad with her announcement that the next elections would be held in two months, in march 1977; she also ordered all political prisoners released. she was confident that the opposition leaders, with very little time to reorganize their lives and campaigns after nineteen months in prison, would be defeated in the elections and that she would emerge with a substantial majority in the new parliament.

it's been a year since i made one of the best decisions for my daily commute: getting an electric bicycle. and honestly, it's been a game-changer. i wanted to share my experience and open up a conversation about how we approach transportation in india.
my trex air cost around ₹35,000, though thanks to my company's wellbeing subsidy, i didn't pay for it directly. but even without the subsidy, i was committed to getting an e-cycle for my office commute. this thing has a solid 50km range on a single charge, which easily covers my daily needs.
i'm constantly baffled by the sight of 150cc bikes used for short commutes and luxury cars carrying just one person to the office. it's frustrating to see our traffic worsen, air quality drop, and roads take such a beating. while i know our public transport and infrastructure have their flaws, i also feel like we, as individuals, are so quick to embrace comfort and status symbols, often shunning public transport even when it's an option. it's disheartening to witness this across india.
why do we need such powerful vehicles for simple commutes? it's not just about personal choice; it's bad for the environment, it creates more traffic, and it puts immense strain on our already fragile road network. in india, with our population density, every small action has significant consequences.
my hope is that we can collectively start thinking beyond individual convenience or showing off, and consider what's better for the environment and for everyone else. it's a tough ask, i know. but if my post encourages even one person to consider an e-cycle or public transport for their daily commute, i'll consider it a win.
i truly believe my generation, gen z, has the potential to be more thoughtful about our surroundings and lead the charge towards a more sustainable future.

reddit,2025-06-26 19:42:08,"the honking problem - solution one of the most annoying things on indian roads is the **constant unnecessary honking by the drivers**. here's one **potential solution** to reduce this problem.

1. the horn in all newly manufactured vehicles in india should be **powered by a replaceable battery** \- a simple plug and remove type battery we see in tv remotes, dslr cameras etc.

2. the battery will be placed in a locked compartment which can only be opened with the vehicle key - this is to prevent theft and battery safety.

3. the battery voltage will be standardized as per the horn power requirements of the vehicle types - two wheeler, 4 wheeler &amp; heavy vehicles (3 or 4 battery voltages/types in total).

4. in common terms, the battery power will be indicated in **""honk seconds.""** as a standard, all battery types  will come with **""1800""** honk seconds out of the box. this means, the battery will run out after honking for **1800 seconds.** this gives an average of **10 honking seconds per day for up to 6 months.** the battery will run out in 3 months if you honk on an average 20 seconds per day. the battery life depends on the usage pattern.

5. once the battery runs out, it needs to be replaced by a new battery. the new batteries will be available in all existing electrical outlets, car service centers, general stores, super markets, online etc.

6. the batteries **will be intentionally expensive** \- roughly 2k for a 2 wheeler battery, 3k for 4 wheeler battery, 4k for heavy vehicles battery.

7. any **tampering** with the battery compartment (other than replacing the battery), horn power connections etc. will **void the vehicle warranty and/or insurance.**

8. the battery charge percentage/level will be displayed on the vehicle instrument cluster so that users are aware of the replacement timelines.

9. the used batteries should be **recycled** to r**educe wastage**.

**conclusion**: the overall objective of this solution is to bring **sensibility &amp; accountability to the indian drivers** who honk mindlessly. the limited battery capacity, the cost and hassle to replace the battery will **create friction and will lead to responsible honking** over a period of time. people who do not bother to replace an expired battery can no longer use the horn."

reddit,2025-06-27 11:17:06,"why is india full of sick people man. let's just it aside everything, religion, politics, infrastructure, everything. and analyse it from the beginning.

so first of all. what do we lack. main thing is. we don't look good. not as 'we people'. but our villages, cities, states and the whole country doesn't look good. why?

simply because of aesthetics. and it is not a genz thing. we need good air. so that we see a beautiful sky above us. for that we need to fix our aqi. for that we need to lessen our pollution. now, how can we do that. we need to remove things that do pollution in the cities. 

so, i looked upto some websites, the thing that contributes most to pollution in india is industrial emissions. they contribute 51% of it. that is a huge amount. 

now, i don't know how we can control this. if you know, simply comment about it. 

the vehicles, crop burning and construction contribute the other 49%. now, we need to control this. we can't control vehicles. but crop burning and construction can be controlled. but to be honest, we can't control them either. crop burning is a village thing. and as you might know, farmers are not so educated in india. so absolutely they won't stop burning crop. now remains construction. 
we can't stop it either. because it needs good, and sensible people to be in the construction sector. but we only have babus here. 

so air quality is not gonna be fixed in india, until the next generation takes over. which will simply because more sensible. and that will at least take 20 years. so we are not gonna have a good weather till 2045 i guess. 

now for aesthetics main thing we need is, to look clean. and not to look. but to be clean. 
don't you like when your surroundings are clean like your mum cleans your house. or where you live. me personally, i am a very hygeinic person. i live in a pg in pune. and i keep it very clean. 

but what astonishes me is that they think this is too much. they say why do you even clean it. won't maid do it. 
see now, our maid comes once a 3 days. and she too doens't clean neatly. and bathroom, just leave it. i have seen rooms of my pg mates, and it's disgusting. males honestly don't care about cleanliness. but its such a basic thing that i am just disgusted by them. 
my friend move into a pg where her girlfriend lives. he said that they are very clean. i mean i know girls in india like to be clean. you are the problem that thinks that cleanliness isnt a necessity. 

they even throw packets on roads. and such. and when i ask them to not do it. they simply say that all the people do it. ain't nothin gonna happen if we dont do it. 

im tired of such people mann.
its always the people. it was never about bjp, hindus, muslims, politics, etc. 
i have a muslim friend who literally says never ever got any discrimination based on religion. 

its always people. 

and we will need at least 20-30 years to have civic sense.
until we meet again

honestly would love your outrages about things too."

transferring vehicle from other state to karnataka – my rto saga (7 visits 😩)

so i recently transferred my car from another state to karnataka, and man it was a pain. i had to take time off from work, like 2 hrs away each time, just to finish rto work. took me 7 visits to finally complete everything. here’s what i went through:

step 1: fill all these forms:

form 27 k.m.v

form 14 k.m.v

(make sure it says k.m.v, normal 27/14 is different lol)

original rc

noc from old state

address proof (rental agreement + last 3 months electricity bill)

form 28

pollution certificate

insurance copy
(if you're transferring ownership, some more forms are there. good luck.)
buy a brown paper file and tag, a small zip lock cover to keep original rc.it will be available in any nearby xerox shop of rto.

go to g-2 room on ground floor to get all these signed.

step 2: go to some other room to get invoice and car details. one madam will pull records and sign. but servers are mostly down. i had to go next day just for this 😑

step 3: tax calculation happens in g-2 by another madam. she will give you the amount. no upi, no online. only dd. welcome to 2005.

step 4: after tax calculated, go get it verified by a-rto sir or rto sir (between 3:30-5pm only)(.[edit] your penalty starts 1% per month from the start date of noc. so make sure you do it asap. don't delay it.  calculation as follows . x is total price. , calculate date difference. base end date is 15 years from registation. calculate percentage based on difference. your tax will be 14% of the remaining percentage. + some cess + 1% penality if you delay. i had to pay ~10,000 as cess + 2 000 penality. for eg. if your noc was created on 29th day of month, and you go next month 2nd day,you will need to pay 1 month penalty. as new month will start. )

step 5: now go to bank to create dd. only cheque allowed. no cash. so tax + dd charges. more money and time.

step 6: take dd back to rto, g-2 room. another madam sitting infront of system will enter your details.(only 11:00-1:30, if you go in afternoon, theh will send you back and ask to come next day morning)

step 7: go give the dd at cash counter, get the invoice. keep the customer copy safe.

step 8: take chasis print (pencil rubbing) on form 27 k.m.v.

step 9: go back to g-2 madam for signature near chasis print.

step 10: produce the vehicle for inspection (only between 12 to 1:30 pm). they’ll check car, maybe note something.

step 11: post-inspection, the guy tells you to go g4 room. they just stamp it. 10 mins.

step 12: go to 3rd floor with all docs – aadhar, pan, all forms, invoice, everything. write your address on speed post envelope. (they'll give it to you. but ask if they forget.)

step 13: you’ll get new rc to your address in about a month.

step 14: your number plate won’t change till now. if you want ka number, then come back after 90 days. madam told it’s not mandatory tho. so chill if you don’t want ka plate.

not gonna lie, this whole process tested my patience. hope this helps someone. carry photocopies, carry pen, and carry patience.

so starting from the beginning, a guy called us on 24th june from this number (96471 - doing this because reddit removing post- 07161). he said our electricity meter number isn’t registered, so we need to come to the office and update it. we said okay, we’ll do it in a few days.

then he told us, you can also update it through phone also. but before that, he said we have to pay the electricity bill for the previous month, which was around ₹5000-6000. (context: we had taken a new bses rajdhani meter connection just 3–4 months back.)

we thought, okay, that’s easier than going to the bses office and all that hassle. but we still had doubts that this could be a fraud or scam, so i told him, we’ll look into this and update you accordingly.

after 2–3 days, since we didn’t take any action, he called again asking why we haven’t updated yet. that’s when we got into action. i discussed it with my father and asked the guy how we could update it online. but before proceeding, i wanted to verify if he was legit or not. so i asked him for every possible detail:- my father's name, mobile number, house address, ca number

he answered everything correctly, and my doubt was gone. and then he said, i'm sending you the payment link, and after that, i’ll send the second link to register the meter. (we said okay).

then he texted us ""hii” and shared the link. (i have the screenshot, but i'm unable to post it here since i’m not getting the option to post an image in this community.)

my father was just about to pay, but luckily he showed me the message before doing it. and the moment i saw the link: (electricity billupd 89 wix site com / my-site-1) i have edited few things from url because of reddit guidelines not to attach a link in a post, but i was shocked.

it was a wix site, clearly fake. no government or official bses portal would ever use something like that. and just after sending the link, instead of calling normally, the guy called me on whatsapp. he wasn’t picking up regular calls, either. i abused him a little out of anger, and he cut the call and blocked me. his number isn’t connecting anymore on normal call i think he blocked me.

this whole thing really shook me. i know how to read and verify urls, but what about people who don’t? people like my father, who could’ve easily gotten trapped in this scam. that’s what scares me the most.

now i really need answers from you all:

* \- how did he get all my personal details, like name, address, ca number, etc.?
* \- am i overthinking, or was that website clearly fake?
* \- is that mobile number (96--471-- 071--61) legit, or linked to previous scams?
* \- how can i properly verify these things in the future?
* \- i want to take strict action against him, but i also don’t want to get stuck in unnecessary legal hassle since i’m working full-time."

today right outside my home i was approached by this young girl with her mother and what i think was her brother. 
they started off with asking if i was tamilian or if i knew tamilians in the area. i responded in the negative since i started living here like 4 months ago lol. 
i thought she was done and was about to head in when she started yapping more about this organisation where she's from where they're spreading awareness about ""social media use"" and ""how to limit it"" . i was like that's actually nice. someone stepping out to do door to door for a cause like that and it's a young person too. she then followed it up with this website they had that i could visit to learn more.
i was like hmmm alr and take the card she hands me out. i take a moment to look at it and it's a nice plain looking card with a ""jw.org"" and they head out and qr code. i check the website and it seems alright with more news articles and this post about buying a bible(weird right?) and all but it does not look like a small ngo or anything. i scroll down and lo and behold it says jehovah's witness. 

(if you don't know jehovah's witness is a very questionable organisation with culty practices)

now there's a bunch of issues i have with this:
1) the girl nowhere mentioned religion . that it was a gimmick to convert me to her religion. i am not opposed to proselytizing as such but the willful deception left a sour taste.

2) the girl seemed like she was around 14-16 which is crazy since she is out advocating for a religion when she isn't even old enough to take accountability or understand things like these.  

3) she seemed like she was groomed to do this. confident voice, eye contact and well pitched speech, it all seemed quite practised.


at the end of the day, it also makes me sad knowing the youth is being pushed into all this garbage. our nation was supposed to start leaving these things behind but it looks like these global organisations have started picking on developing nations since their own are heading towards atheism :/"

i need some help with a bh series car transfer issue.

i bought a car and got it registered in mumbai under the bh series back in february 2022. i sold it in april 2024 to a buyer in bangalore. he isn’t eligible for bh series registration, but he said he would handle the transfer. i signed all the papers, paid the road tax again, and then moved to the uk thinking everything was done.

now, the buyer is facing problems transferring the car to his name. the rto in bangalore says they don’t know how to transfer a bh number, and they’ve even said it’s not possible. he also tried to convert it to a regular mh number, but that didn’t work either.

i’m quite worried about this and want to know the correct way to transfer a bh registered car to someone who isn't eligible for bh, especially if they’re in a different state.

from what i understand, the process should involve getting an noc from the mumbai rto, submitting the right forms, and then the buyer re-registering it in bangalore with a new ka number and paying the road tax there. but it seems like the both the mh and ka rtos don’t have/know a clear process for this.

has anyone here done this before? any help or guidance would be really appreciated. both the buyer and i are stuck right now and not sure what to do next.

thanks a lot in advance!"
reddit,2025-06-29 21:10:04,"uttarahalli- kengeri road: a daily hell ride that desperately needs attention hello fellow bengalureans,

i’ve been commuting via the uttarahalli kengeri road for the past six months, mostly on weekends, and what was once a tolerable patch of road has now deteriorated into a nightmare. it has genuinely gone from bad to worse, and that’s putting it mildly.

this stretch has become a near-constant obstacle course. there’s gravel scattered across the road, deep diamond-shaped cuts, missing patches of road, and more potholes than i can count. in many places, the road feels like a continuous rumble strip for several kms. and when you throw in peak-hour traffic, it becomes a hazardous and bone-rattling hell ride every single day.

i had hoped some patchwork would be done before the monsoons, but instead, the situation has only gotten worse. during the heavy rains in may, parts of the road had knee-deep water, two-wheelers were stalling, and i witnessed several vehicles with dead engines struggling to restart. for a road used by thousands daily, this is beyond unacceptable.

this road  connects major points such as rnsit, bgs, jss, and sattva global city. it’s also lined with several gated communities from top builders including sobha, brigade, prestige, and mantri. given the sheer number of institutions, tech employees, and local residents relying on this road, it’s shocking how neglected it has become.

i remember reading about a terrible accident last year on this very road, after which residents of a nearby gated community blocked the road in protest. clearly, that momentum has faded, but the issues persist and have multiplied.

i want to ask those of you living along this stretch:

1. how are you commuting on this road everyday?

2. has anyone raised this issue with the local mlas?

(i believe this road falls between bengaluru south and
 rr nagar assembly constituencies and do the folks representing them have responded positively to this?)

3. has anyone approached the ruling party or bbmp officials or anyone else on this matter?

given that this is a densely populated area with a strong voter base, we must ask — why is there zero will to fix it? i truly hope that residents from these areas come together to pressurise the authorities to fix this road.

let’s not wait for another accident or monsoon disaster. if you reside here, please raise your voice. use your vote wisely and press the authorities to take immediate action. 

this isn’t just about convenience. it’s about safety, dignity, and the livability of our city, which i’m sure is dear to all of us.

thanks for reading. let’s hope this post sparks some accountability and hope that damn road is fixed asap."

hey guys, just moved to bengaluru recently for my master's and i'm currently staying at a pg. i was wary going in because of numerous horror stories i've heard about pgs, so i was surprised when everything seemed to be pretty straightforward and decent(pressure on the tap in the bathroom nonwithstanding but i can live with that.)

being in a rush with my university opening recently , i hadn't gotten a chance to use my laptop till today. i used it for a while without charging and then figured i should charge it for a while before i sleep so that i can take it with me the next day.

i plug it in, go to shut the lid of the laptop and... weird... my hand kind of just jumped back, again. this time i realised it was a shock. 

at first i thought it was static, but it was way too strong for that. using a series of very stupid experiments i concluded that i still got shocked even when the switch was off. but as soon as i disconnected the power plug thing from the laptop it was fine(laptop was working flawlessly all this while.) 

what's going on here? this charger was working fine till i moved here, why has it started to spazz out now? or is it something wrong with the power source? any way to fix this? i get the feeling that fighting with the pg guys about this is going to be a bother. 

edit
alright so update everyone along with some more info. pg isn't an old building, was built just two years ago or so. i tried using it again today with the charger plugged in and it was a-okay. i'm guessing this was probably a build up of static electricity or something but for now i'm sorted. thanks for all the replies in the dead of night :)"

just before or after the monsoon, there’s always a wave of road repairs — new tar, fresh patches, the usual. but within a few months, potholes are back, the surface is cracking again, and it's like the work never happened. some roads get repaired every year, and yet nothing actually improves.

so i’m really wondering:

why does this keep happening across almost every part of india?

is it just poor materials and bad planning? or is it more about corruption and lack of accountability?

where does all the allocated budget for road repairs actually go? is there any transparency at all?


if anyone here works in government contracts, construction, or knows how these tenders and repair projects actually work, i’d love to hear your thoughts. even locals who’ve seen this process happen in their area — please share your experience.

also, are there any cities or states where roads are actually built to last? would be great to know if someone’s doing it right.

reddit,2025-07-02 08:07:23,"car pool is picking up but its still 10% in bengaluru my nexon is resting at parking for 1.5 years now.  i have a simple philosophy - there is ample cars on the road on orr. unfortunately 50% are single driver. encourage them to carpool. quickride is leading app which i use for professional carpool which is almost free and helped each single day till bike taxi ban. even if your time is not fixed, add ride. you can inform if you are 10 minutes late. people adjust accordingly. or when you starting getting ready put quickride. there are lakhs waiting to be picked. nobody wanna use cab and auto for office.

because connecting point of pick or drop will not be at my home so i have to move 1-2 km here and there. auto don't accept. bike taxis do. but after ban its become so difficult to travel.

27,000+ are using quickride in bengaluru , which is unfortunately very low in bengaluru. which has the traffic of 4 lakh car daily. it means 90% of us not offering car pool.

80,000 per day bike taxi need to be compensated. it is not easy. with more and more companies asking to come to office. car pool is only solution.

few tips:
ride giver
it takes 5 minutes extra total to navigate and pick people. your fuel will be free henceforth, but here you do social service and you will make good network and friends. also keep 5 fuel point, because they already have to pay 50-60 bucks to reach pickup point. after few weeks you will be pro.
also navigate to pickup location first and then to destination. i understand sometime route deviates but it is easy approach to ensure that those accepted will be covered.

ride taker: see quickride before booking cab, auto. it is highly likely that you may get someway to reach. taking off car, bike is collective efforts. always reach 5 minutes before time. no one deviate route for you. also thanks ride giver.

if all do, traffic problem will be solved in a day. encourage in your society group. take the pain for few days, to eradicate pain forever.

many tried quickride before covid, but now things changed drastically. they have etiquette tutorial, user rating, company details, verification etc to make informed decision. actually we are not helping them, but collectively ourselves, our planet, traffic reduction and sense of fulfillment also."
reddit,2025-07-02 10:14:39,"quick commerce delivery guys are creating havoc on roads – it’s high time we talk about this i really need to get this off my chest. i’m not here to blame the delivery guys themselves—most of them are just trying to make a living, and i have immense respect for how hard they work. many come from tough backgrounds and are doing their best to support their families. this post is not against them.

but the way these quick commerce apps operate… it’s honestly creating chaos on the roads.

you see these delivery guys zipping around at 20+ kmph in the wrong direction on busy roads, squeezing through impossible gaps, appearing out of nowhere from blind spots, or worse—driving on footpaths. many of them don’t wear helmets. a lot are riding these yulu-sized electric bikes that are barely roadworthy for such high-traffic, fast-paced city roads.

it’s not just a nuisance anymore—it’s becoming a serious safety issue, for them and for others. pedestrians, cyclists, drivers—we’re all at risk.

and let’s be real, it’s the companies behind this who are at fault. they push these riders to deliver as quickly as possible, lure them with speed-based bonuses, and make time the only kpi that matters. there’s no regard for traffic rules, basic road safety, or even rider welfare.

imo, there needs to be some form of regulation:
	•	helmets should be mandatory and provided by the companies.
	•	riders should be trained in basic traffic laws.
	•	delivery time expectations need to be realistic, not life-threatening.
	•	footpaths should be off-limits. period.

we can’t let our roads turn into obstacle courses just to save someone 5 minutes on milk and bread.

tl;dr: quick commerce delivery guys are driving dangerously — wrong side, no helmets, footpaths, etc. i don’t blame them entirely; they’re just trying to do their job. but the apps pushing for insane delivery speeds with bonuses are putting everyone at risk. we need better safety rules and accountability from these companies."

lately, i find myself growing increasingly disillusioned with the direction our country is heading. for the longest time, i believed in the ""developing nation"" narrative — that while progress might be slow, it would be steady and forward-moving. but what i see around me feels like the exact opposite. it doesn't look like development anymore. it feels like **decay**.

roads are crumbling, garbage is piling up, the rule of law feels non-existent. goondaism, hooliganism, and even linguistic extremism seem to be getting mainstreamed. and this isn't limited to one state or one political party — **every party is the same**, chasing votes with freebies and short-term gimmicks instead of real, structural reforms. no one seems genuinely interested in nation-building anymore — only in winning the next election.

**corruption has seeped into every nook and corner of daily life.** roads and highways are being built with thousands of crores of public money, only to get washed away in the very next monsoon. no one is held accountable, no one is punished, and worst of all — no one even seems to care anymore. it’s just accepted as the norm.

the justice system is painfully slow — with cases dragging on for decades — and that only emboldens criminals. social divisions are widening dangerously along lines of religion, language, and region. and even our most ""developed"" cities like bengaluru or mumbai are collapsing under the weight of poor infrastructure and unchecked growth.

i know no country is perfect. i know the grass always looks greener on the other side. but i’m not asking for perfection. just the basics — clean air, decent roads, functioning infrastructure, and the hope that my taxes are being used for something meaningful. these are things that **many other countries treat as basic entitlements**, while here they still feel like privileges.

i’m genuinely reaching a point of desperation where leaving india feels like the only way forward for a better life. but i also wonder — **am i focusing too much on the negatives?** is this frustration clouding my perspective?

the shop has:

* steady school footfall
* local residents from the colony
* people from nearby well-off colony
* several gyms nearby
* 50 sq ft extra storage space
* electricity, with plumbing possible

my parents can supervise day-to-day operations, and i can hire 1–2 staff if needed. i want to build something practical, ideally with good margins and steady demand, but not overly complex to manage.

**i’d really value your suggestions on:**

* what kind of business would fit best in this area?
* what products or services do you think would sell well here?
* any challenges or lessons i should keep in mind before investing?

open to any creative or realistic ideas — i don’t want to get stuck in the same middle-class grocery routine if there’s a better opportunity. thanks so much for your thoughts, delhi! 🙏

i wanted to share a frustrating and honestly shocking experience i’m having with my landlord here in bangalore.

my landlord just handed me a water bill of ₹7325 for 3 months. yes, over seven thousand rupees, just for water!

a few points for context:

we are three people living in a 2bhk.
we’re a small family with normal usage — showers, cooking, washing clothes. nothing excessive at all.
when i first moved in, the broker clearly said water was included in the ₹2000 monthly service charge.
on top of that, the building is a standalone apartment with absolutely zero facilities — no pool, no gym, nothing.
there is a borewell in the building, so it’s not even fully dependent on bwssb water.

when i questioned him, he just brushed it off saying ""everyone pays this much."" what’s worse: he refuses to provide an actual water bill. no transparency at all.

we feel completely stuck because he is holding ₹1.3 lakh security deposit, and we’re afraid he might just deduct or refuse to return it if we argue too much.

i genuinely feel this is part of a bigger problem in bangalore — landlords acting like a mafia, overcharging tenants without any justification, and using security deposits to threaten us into silence.

has anyone else faced such insane water charges or similar tactics?

can we legally demand an actual bwssb bill?
any advice on how to handle this without risking our deposit?"

reddit,2025-07-06 08:51:04,"personal opinion about why the state government prefer taxi unions over techies according to bbmp reports, bangalore has about 1 crore voters out of its estimated 1.4 crore population. average voter turnout in bangalore is around 51% - 54%. that makes roughly 30% of bangalore population. now, the estimated population of bangalore, most probably doesn't count migrant workers and other unregistered residents. that would bring the percentage further down.

elections are no longer about popularity or majorities approval. they are well calculated, planned fights for parties. it is sad, but it is what it is. for a candidate to win in bangalore, out of the 30% that would vote, with at least 5 popular candidates or parties, guess how much vote percentage is needed! slightly above 6? and who are those 6% of bangalore? and how much is required to be captured to make sure that a particular candidate is lost?

i mean no offence when saying this, the worst bangalore white collars would do is file an online petition or make a social media post. they are disconnected from the grass root population and live in a fancier reality. they wouldn't go to rallies on offers of food or clothes. they wouldn't put up posters or participate in door to door campaigns. maybe donate to their parties, but there are always corporates and other entities who make up majority of the donors. guess who does! 

and the cry for bike taxis is only in bangalore. not even in the nearby districts. guess who is present in all of karnataka? guess how many nom bangaloreans are worried about the state of bangalore and the traffic problems there on a daily basis. guess how many of them reads social media posts about it and goes through online petitions. and guess how many are 6% of bangalore population compared to the overall population of karnataka. sunday mornings are good for fun math. i will leave it to you.

ofcourse, the white collars pay income tax. that goes to the centre. and guess how much of it the state gets back as its share! all 5 southern states and maharashtra for that matter. an average techie in bangalore is essentially good only for the amount of money he/she spend out of his income. and the 200rs professional tax per month. what is the best way to make them spend money earned in bangalore in bangalore? by making the essentials cost more. and transport is something that makes top of the list. having it companies in bangalore doesn't help it directly. it is about the business around them. cab, hotels, pubs, real estate etc. 

why would people who doesn't vote and who doesn't do grass root level work for them, who doesn't spend as much as they can would matter to the government? i am not worried about the downvotes on unpopular opinion, but please try to understand the reality and think about what can you do to make your voice heard."

reddit,2025-07-06 19:54:18,"how can we fix bangalore? hey guys, genuine question here &amp; looking for serious replies.

i’ve been living in bangalore for 23 years now. i seriously love this city; i get homesick even if i leave for a few days to another state or country.

there’s something about bangalore that just feels like home.

but at the same time, i feel like the city is falling apart in so many ways. there’s so much potential, but it feels like we’re wasting it.

1. the roads are tiny and congested all the time.
2. insane traffic
3. no proper footpaths.
4. potholes everywhere.
5. one day of rain and half the city is flooded. (i live in hennur, and during the recent floods they had to bring in boats, firetrucks and jcb to get rid of water and last year a building collapsed which caused a construction worked to die and others injured.)
6. i love dogs, but in some areas, the number of street dogs are too much which is not good for humans or the dogs themselves (i’ve seen injured, crippled dogs, once even saw one that was almost skinned. it’s messed up)
7. garbage is just lying around in so many places. the city looks dirty, and there’s no proper system.

(i think the language problem deserves its own post, so skipping that for now. 😅)

what are we doing? we call bangalore the silicon valley of india. startups are booming, tech is growing, people are building great stuff and i think a great environment and urban infrastructure would be encouraging to have all these brilliant people build stuff here.

\&gt; i feel like the people who are in power (mostly boomers) - don’t care.  
they just fill their pockets and move on.  
\&gt; and the older generation of citizens are too used to this mess to even bother.

\&gt; meanwhile, most gen z folks i know are just focused on making money and getting out of here.

so what’s left? who’s supposed to fix all this?  
curious to hear from young people here or anyone in a position to do something.

can we take lessons from any successful city and follow their roadmap?  
do we need a proper movement?  
what’s your honest take on this?

are we just supposed to keep adapting and surviving?  
or is there a way to turn things around?

is anyone here working in urban development, policy, activism, or even just thinking seriously about this stuff? would love to hear from you; especially young people or folks in roles where change is possible.

reddit,2025-07-09 15:42:47,"would this data convince you to adopt e-cycles in bangalore? this post comes from seeing countless complaints about bangalore traffic. i believe e-cycles offer a practical solution, and the data supports this. here’s a comprehensive analysis of how e-cycle adoption could transform our city.

**the current crisis: bangalore by the number**s

**traffic impact**: average speeds drop to **17.6 kmph** during peak hours. the city loses ₹**3,700 crore** annually due to congestion, with **1.18 million** residents wasting **600 million man-hours** stuck in traffic.

**air quality**: pm2.5 levels are **5-6 times higher** than who guidelines. transport contributes **19.7% of pm10 emissions**, making air quality poor on 33% of days annually.

**growth trajectory**: vehicle registrations grew from 180 per 1000 people (1980) to 510 per 1000 (2016) - a 183% increase in 36 years.

**the netherlands case study: what actually works**

**the starting point (1970s)**: dutch cities faced similar problems - 3,300 annual road deaths, 500+ children killed by cars, and car-dominated infrastructure.

the critical transformation timeline:

• **policy shift:** 5-7 years (1971-1978) following oil crisis catalyst

• **basic infrastructure**: 15 years (1976-1990) for core cycling networks

• **cultural change**: 20-25 years for cycling to become normalized

• **full transformation**: 50 years to reach current levels

**key insight**: the dutch didn’t wait for perfect infrastructure. they started with immediate policy changes and temporary solutions, then built permanent infrastructure around emerging usage patterns.

**the tipping points: when e-cycle adoption creates real impact**

***critical mass thresholds (based on urban planning research):***

**5-8% modal share: traffic congestion begins measurable reduction**

• noise pollution drops 3-5 decibels

• air quality improves 8-12% in cycling corridors

• average speeds increase 2-4 kmph for all vehicles

**12-15% modal share: significant system changes**

• public health metrics improve (emergency room visits down 15-20%)

• business districts see increased foot traffic (15-25% revenue increase)

• infrastructure investments shift toward cycling-friendly development

**25%+ modal share: transformation becomes self-sustaining**

• cultural shift complete - cycling becomes socially normal

• safety dramatically improves (cyclist fatality rates drop 60-70%)

• economic benefits compound (dutch model: ₹19 billion annually in health savings)

**the science: quantified benefits of e-cycle adoption**

**individual health impact:**

• 21% reduction in all-cause mortality

• 20% reduction in cardiovascular mortality

• 11-18% lower heart attack risk

• 20% reduced type 2 diabetes risk

**environmental impact:**

• 92% less co2 than cars (21g vs 271g per passenger/km)

• 40-50% injury reduction for all road users in areas with cycling infrastructure

• 0.80-1.78% reduction in national co2 emissions if short trips shift to cycling

**economic returns:**

• 4:1 to 6:1 roi on cycling infrastructure investments

• ₹18.6 billion annual economic benefit (netherlands model scaled)

• 36% productivity increase for employees in cycling wellness programs

**hidden insights: what the data reveals**

**network effects**: e-cycle adoption accelerates exponentially, not linearly. each 1% increase in cycling modal share makes cycling 15-20% safer for everyone due to increased visibility and infrastructure attention.

**infrastructure follows usage**: cities that achieved cycling transformation built infrastructure in response to cycling adoption, not before it. temporary measures (painted bike lanes, bike-share programs) often preceded permanent infrastructure by 3-5 years.

**weather resilience**: dutch data shows year-round cycling rates above 60% even in rain/cold, debunking weather as a barrier once cycling becomes normalized.

**safety paradox:** areas with more cyclists are significantly safer. utrecht (51% cycling modal share) has 6x lower cyclist fatality rates than areas with minimal cycling infrastructure.

**bangalore adoption timeline: a realistic projection**

**phase 1: early adoption (6-12 months)**

• target: 2-3% modal share in it corridors

• catalyst: corporate wellness programs, individual early adopters

• infrastructure: painted bike lanes, basic parking

• expected impact: 5-8% traffic reduction in tech corridors during peak hours

**phase 2: growing momentum (12-24 months)**

• target: 5-8% modal share citywide

• catalyst: e-bike sharing programs, government incentives

• infrastructure: protected lanes on major routes, charging stations

• expected impact: measurable air quality improvement, 15% reduced commute times

**phase 3: critical mass (24-36 months)**

• target: 12-15% modal share

• catalyst: cultural normalization, safety improvements

• infrastructure: comprehensive network, integrated with public transport

• expected impact: self-sustaining adoption, significant health benefits visible

**phase 4: transformation (36-60 months)**

• target: 20%+ modal share

• catalyst: policy shift toward cycling-first planning

• infrastructure: dutch-level integration

• expected impact: bangalore becomes cycling success story for indian cities

**the critical success factors**

**government support**: karnataka’s ev policy provides tax exemptions and ₹50,000 crore investment targets. 8,000+ charging stations planned.

**corporate programs:** companies offering cycling incentives show 45% higher employee retention and 14-19% reduced absenteeism.

**technology integration**: e-cycles address bangalore’s 8-15km typical commute distances and terrain challenges that limited traditional cycling.

**why this moment matters**

**adoption speed**: based on indian urban adoption patterns, e-cycles could reach mainstream acceptance within 18-24 months - far faster than traditional infrastructure development that takes 8-18 years.

**first-mover advantage**: early adopters in bangalore will shape infrastructure development and policy. the dutch transformation started with individual choice, not government mandate.

**compound benefits**: each person who switches to e-cycling makes cycling safer and more attractive for others, creating positive feedback loops.

**the bottom line**

e-cycles aren’t just environmentally friendly - they’re scientifically proven to be faster, healthier, and more economical for short-to-medium distance urban transport.

the netherlands took 50 years because they were pioneering. we have their roadmap and can compress the timeline dramatically.

the question isn’t whether bangalore will develop cycling infrastructure - it’s whether you’ll be part of the early wave that shapes how it develops.

**what are your concerns, fears, or questions about e-cycle adoption in bangalore?**"
reddit,2025-07-09 18:18:04,"has anyone installed solar panels plus battery for their apartment buildings? hey r/india!

i’ve been researching solar panels for apartment buildings and wondering if anyone here has actually installed them? with rising electricity costs across the country and the pm surya ghar scheme, it seems like a good time to explore this.

**what i found so far:**

*the numbers (example for 3kw system):*

- total cost: ₹1,90,000 - ₹2,15,000 (varies by city/state)
- central government subsidy: ₹78,000 (pm surya ghar scheme)
- **net cost after subsidy: ₹1,12,000 - ₹1,37,000**
- for a 3-apartment building: ₹37,000 - ₹45,000 per flat
- monthly savings: ₹1,500 - ₹3,000 per apartment (depends on local electricity rates)
- payback time: 18-30 months

*the process:*

1. apply on pmsuryaghar.gov.in
1. wait for local discom approval (supposed to be 15 days)
1. choose empanelled vendor from your state
1. installation takes 3-5 days
1. get subsidy in bank account within 30 days

**what seems universal:**

- net metering available across most states
- no special building permissions needed in most places
- works for individual houses, apartment complexes, housing societies
- helps india reduce coal dependency and meet renewable energy targets
- property values reportedly increase 10-15%

**my questions for anyone who’s done this:**

1. **which state/city are you in** and how was your experience?
1. **state-specific subsidies?** some states offer additional incentives
1. **discom cooperation?** how helpful was your local electricity board?
1. **actual vs projected savings?** did you really save what they promised?
1. **apartment building logistics?** how did you handle cost-sharing, maintenance agreements?
1. **battery backup?** worth the extra cost or stick to grid-tied?
1. **vendor experiences?** any recommendations or companies to avoid?
1. **monsoon performance?** how much does generation drop during rainy season?

**my concerns:**

- **state variations**: each state seems to have different policies and discoms
- **building society approvals**: getting all residents to agree and contribute
- **long-term maintenance**: who’s responsible after warranty expires?
- **technology changes**: will better/cheaper tech make current investment obsolete?
- **moving**: how does investment recovery work if you sell/move?

**why i’m considering this:**

beyond the financial benefits, india’s pushing hard for renewable energy targets and reducing coal dependence. plus with climate change and rising energy costs, seems like a good hedge for the future.

**looking for real experiences from across india:**

- which states have the best additional incentives?
- any horror stories with installations or vendors?
- tips for convincing apartment societies/neighbors?
- how’s the actual performance vs promises?

also curious about different building types - individual houses, small apartments, large complexes. what works best?

thanks in advance for sharing your experiences!"

every single day, my neighbours who proudly claim to be “well-settled” and run businesses worth lakhs throw their leftover food right next to our house. and i’m not talking about a few scraps it’s enough to feed three people. they literally dump full plates of uneaten food on the roadside like it’s a designated garbage zone. the worst part? it’s not even in front of their own house they throw it near ours.

we don’t even throw our own trash on the street, and here they are dumping full meals like it’s nothing. we’ve tried speaking to them politely, even confronted them after seeing it happen but they deny it every time. classic: “hum nahi daalte” while it’s clearly them. i’ve seen it with my own eyes.

i’d say it’s animal like behaviour, but that would honestly be an insult to animals. even str ay dogs have more dignity.

to make things worse, garbage collectors don’t pick up this kind of food waste, so it sits there rotting for 3–4 days until some animal carries it off. the moment it’s gone, the cycle repeats. it smells, it attracts pests, and it’s absolutely disgusting.

my parents, especially my mom, tell me not to confront them aggressively because we should “keep the peace.” but i’m at my limit now. i’ve thought of putting up a sign on the wall.

 how can you help right now?  
  
1. tag anyone you know in the bangalore traffic office, bbmp or the traffic commissioner’s office, let this hit the right inbox.

reddit,2025-07-16 10:09:25,"is the kannadiga vs non-kannadiga rift every politician’s wet dream? i was traveling in an airport cab to kia. the driver had to brake out of the blue to negotiate a pothole the size of the lunar crater on an arterial road. this manoeuvre led a car trailing us to hit our cab from the rear. both vehicles sustained significant damage.

things escalated into road-rage. my cab driver spoke fluent kannada despite originally being from andhra pradesh (he was speaking to his family in telugu on the phone before the crash). the occupants of the other car were north indians. naturally, my driver played the language card - ‘i’m a local, don’t mess with me. non- kannadigas are spoiling bangalore. i will send you back to bihar’

in all this drama, the root cause of the accident - the pothole was quickly forgotten. if kannadigas &amp; non-kannadigas don’t stand united, the citizens of bangalore will not complain against bad infrastructure or ask for better governance. both groups will assign blame to the other for our state of affairs.

are politicians leveraging this regionalism to ensure nobody questions their incompetence and corruption?"

reddit,2025-07-18 09:15:55,"rains are real testers on bangalore roads every time it rains in bangalore, it’s like a reality check for our roads. what seems fine during dry days suddenly turns into a risky adventure.

potholes are just the beginning. many roads are dug up for repairs or utility work, and then left open or partially completed. add rain to that mix, and it becomes a complete mess. the water fills up the dug-up patches, making it impossible to see what’s underneath — a shallow puddle or a deep crater.

the ones suffering the most are two-wheeler riders. i witnessed a man near frazer town (promenade road), where the streets are being dug, lose control and skid due to an unfinished patch filled with rainwater. he wasn’t speeding — just caught off guard like anyone would be.

bangalore rains don’t just test the roads. they test your patience, your balance, and your luck.

reddit,2025-07-18 13:04:34,"bangalore traffic: the mudslinging needs to stop lately, i’ve been noticing a pattern of posts about the traffic situation in bangalore, especially on the outer ring road (orr). the comments usually end up as arguments between two-wheeler and four-wheeler drivers about who’s at fault. honestly, most of us engaging in these discussions are regular working people, frustrated with the traffic. sure, everyone breaks a few rules now and then, but these online fights don’t really solve anything.

here are a few thoughts:

1. **bigger vehicles cause more delays.** trucks, buses, and construction vehicles are slower and heavier. they often cause jams when they make sudden stops or turns. in comparison, two-wheelers and cars are more agile. even if they get into sticky situations, they usually manage to get moving again quicker.
2. **the reckless drivers we complain about aren’t on reddit.** auto drivers who suddenly stop, make sharp turns, or try to squeeze into bike lanes aren’t reading these posts. the bus drivers who randomly stop to pick up passengers on the orr aren’t here either. you get the idea.
3. **most office-goers are careful drivers.** in my experience, people commuting to work are usually considerate. they care about their vehicles and mostly just want to reach their destination safely and on time. they’re not out to cause problems. four wheeler owners enjoy the safety and comfort, two wheeler owners enjoy the convenience of zipping through traffic quicker.
4. **if we really want to question someone, let’s question the white kurtas in charge of public infrastructure.** just look at the state of metro construction. or the kind of vote-bank politics they keep playing, without any concern for your time or daily struggles. the day bike-taxis stopped congestion immediately got worse. 

in my opinion, one of the best things we can do is register as voters in bangalore. that way, we make sure these folks don’t get too comfortable in power. but then again, i’m not sure how many of us will actually go out and vote. curious to hear about your opinions."
reddit,2025-07-18 16:48:31,"2.5 years, endless paperwork, and still no warehouse — the harsh reality of trying to legally build in india as a mid-sized entrepreneur i want to share the frustrating journey of trying to build a small warehouse in india the *legal* way — and how the system seems actively designed to punish people who follow the rules.

here’s a timeline of what happened:

**phase 1: finding the land (mid-2022)**

* i realized i needed a permanent warehouse space for my growing business.
* from day one, i was clear that i would do everything legally — land purchase, building plans, approvals from local authorities, tax registration, everything by the book.
* i knew the area i was looking in is notorious for land grabbing scams and disputed ownership. to avoid future legal issues, i avoided open plots and chose a commercial gated plotting scheme. this was supposed to offer better documentation, security, and infrastructure.
* i selected a plot that fit my needs, but it required heavy excavation due to hilly terrain.
* the builder promised that the land would be excavated and ready in 2 months, after which we'd complete the sale and registration. i paid an advance based on this promise.

**phase 2: delay after delay (late 2022 to late 2023)**

* the 2-month promise turned into 1 full year just to get the plot excavated and ready.
* registration finally happened, but key amenities like roads, drainage, and fencing were still incomplete.
* i went ahead with the registry anyway, hoping development would progress.
* it took another 6 months for the builder to finish basic infrastructure like fencing, drainage, concrete road, and stormwater drains.

**phase 3: starting legal approvals (jan to may 2025)**

* in january 2025, i hired an architect to start the process of getting legal building permission.
* i was given a list of over 30 documents to be submitted, including:
   * property tax registration
   * zone dakhla and 7/12 extract
   * tax noc
   * survey report
   * title search report covering the past 30 years (which meant hiring a lawyer)
   * documents from a structural engineer
   * documents from a site engineer
   * and many more
* it took nearly 4 months to apply for and collect all these documents from different government offices and individuals.

**phase 4: electricity and plan approval (april to july 2025)**

* around april, i began pushing for electricity access from the builder.
* the builder said that the state electricity board (mseb) currently has ""no available meters"" and i would have to wait. it’s now been over 7 months — still no meter, no connection, and no timeline.
* meanwhile, the architect submitted the building plan for approval and said it would be done in 15 days.
* i was told i’d need to pay a bribe to move the file forward — something that, sadly, is normalized. i reluctantly agreed.
* four months later, just before the final sanction, the architect called to say the approval was blocked due to some arbitrary internal reason. we now have to ""wait it out"" with no clarity or deadline.

**where i stand today (july 2025)**

* it has been 2.5 years since i decided to build a warehouse.
* not a single brick has been laid.
* there’s still no electricity connection.
* no approved building plan.
* i'm continuing to rent another warehouse just to keep my business running, which is bleeding money.
* a fully paid plot lies idle while everyone involved — architect, builder, and government staff — pass the responsibility to someone else.
* what’s worse is seeing people who engage in illegal construction move faster simply because they pay bribes and skip documentation.

**the bigger picture**

this is the sad reality of being a mid-level entrepreneur in india. the idea of ""ease of doing business"" feels like a cruel joke when you try to do things the right way.

following the law should not be a disadvantage. but here, it feels like a punishment.

sometimes i genuinely think about leaving this country for a place where systems are built to help you move forward — where your time and effort are respected.

if anyone has faced something similar, or knows how to push departments like mseb for meter allocation, or how to deal with arbitrary plan rejection — i’d really appreciate any advice.

thanks for reading. just needed to let it out.

**update (as of 10th august): no progress in sanction and meter.**"

reddit,2025-07-19 09:18:35,"power cuts here are insanely bad in my area, is it because no companies or only low/mid-income group people live in this area? living in muneshwara nagar, hosapalaya here the power cut is crazy. previously i used to live in hsr main, but due to hiked rent prices i moved here 4 months ago. i’m facing serious power cut issues here.

this place falls in between hsr layout and kudlu gate, just near the iti layout area. most of the low-income and mid-income group people live here, and there are no workspaces or big companies around, only residential area and a few garment companies. mostly garment workers live near this area.

we are suffering a lot. previously when i was in hsr, power cuts were there but not this serious. i’m not exaggerating one of my roommates is a hybrid worker; only two days work from office, other three days work from home. he suffered a lot.

the problem is the network here is extremely bad. you can’t even make a call when you are inside the building, network is that bad. so we have to rely on wi-fi to work from home. he had to pack everything and go to a friend’s room to work. friend’s room in iti layout surprisingly powercut is not happening there.

at least 4 hours power cut is happening daily. from last week it’s even worse, yes i’m not even exaggerating. yesterday, 5 am power is gone, then it came around 8:30 am. then i went to office. when i returned home at 3:30 pm, power was already not there. it came around 8:30 pm. i don’t know how long it was out before 3:30, even if we don’t consider that, it’s crazy 8 hours.

before that day, they cut the power when i was working from home and i had to go to a friend’s home. we all friends are working, so we used to stock vegetables for 4-5 days in the fridge this is the habit from hsr times. but now all the resources are getting wasted rotten. dosa batter we use to make for 3 days, it goes waste in one day. this is our situation.

but in this area, so many women have to get their school-going children ready, do lunch for them, and then go to work.

the surprising and irritating thing is when current goes off in hsr or my friend’s room in iti layout, immediately, maximum within 30 minutes it will be fixed and current will come.

in this city, major things which the city lifestyle is built upon are messed roads, traffic, network (i can’t even use gpay to pay in shops or make calls inside buildings). for these things we can blame the crowd, but for this worst current, i am paying ₹1000+ every month. that is the most irritating thing.

i see a lot of negativity, pessimism, and a lack of hope in the future of india. i truly do not believe that all of this hatred is organic, but rather, some of it is a part of a greater campaign to demoralize and demonize india. this post highlights many positive and improving **economic** aspects of india and indians. let me know if you'd like a similar write-up for other aspects of india's growth story. 

## india's economic growth story

india’s nominal gdp [doubled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_india) from about $2.1 trillion in 2015 to $4.3 trillion in 2025. in this growth, india jumped from the 10th largest economy in 2014 to now the 4th largest economy in 2025. it is expected to become the [3rd](https://aicc.com.au/india-to-become-3rd-largest-economy-by-2027-market-cap-to-hit-us-10-trillion-by-2030-jefferies/) largest economy in 2027, passing japan. the average annual real growth rate (accounting for inflation) is [6-7%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg?locations=in) post liberalization, with a per capita increase of 5.5–7.5%. the nominal rate (without adjusting for inflation is 9-11% on average since 2014. this far surpasses the old 'hindu growth rate' which took place pre-liberalization (1950-1991) which was [3.5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_india) on average, representing only a 1.5% growth of gdp per capita annually. total [fdi](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/truth-lies-and-politics/focus-on-fdi-receipts-by-india-from-2014-2024-indias-role-in-the-global-supply-chain-in-the-future/) inflow from 2014 to 2024 crossed $500 billion, compared to $200 billion in the decade prior.

in other words, modern growth rates are 2x or more than that of pre-liberalization times. but what about ppp? the current gdp per capita of india stands around $2,878, but in purchasing power parity it is [$12,132](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/ind). why is this important? because ppp adjusts for cost differences. a dollar in india can buy more goods/services than in the us. excluding covid years (and the rebound), the gdp per capita (ppp) increases annually by 5.25% on average. 

india's foreign exchange reserves reached a peak [$700](https://cleartax.in/s/indian-forex-reserves) billion in june, making it the 4th largest in the world. this large reserve covers 11 months of india's imports which provide a substantial safety net in case of economic downturns. higher reserves lead to better credit ratings, such as india's upgrade to bbb in [may](https://dbrs.morningstar.com/research/453673/morningstar-dbrs-upgrades-india-to-bbb-trend-changed-to-stable#).

speaking of [imports/exports](https://www.commerce.gov.in/trade-statistics/), let's turn to india's growth in this sector. $22.94 billion in 1991 compared to $759.93 billion in 2023. more than 30x. the [pharmaceutical](https://www.pib.gov.in/pressreleaseiframepage.aspx?prid=2085345) industry, valued at around $50 billion in 2023, is projected to reach $130 billion by 2030 with india holding a 20% global market share. exports of electronics and a wide range of engineering goods have seen significant growth. multinational corporations like apple, [google](https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/welcome-to-ananta-google-indias-new-campus-in-bengaluru/), amazon, tesla, and samsung have significantly expanded their capacities and workforce in india.

how about services? from negligible figures in 1991, india's [services](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-india-services-economy-became-a-world-leader) exports have grown to $323 billion in 2023. projections suggest $387.5 billion in 2024-25 and potentially $1 trillion in total exports (goods and services) by 2030. since 1991, the service sector has grown more than 7.5% per year.

since 2022, india has had the opportunity to import oil cheaply from russia, decreasing the trade deficit. this, combined with some aforementioned stable policies, has allowed india to keep inflation [relatively lower](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-cooling-inflation-prompts-rate-cut-calls-raises-concerns-over-weakening-2025-07-15/) than in past periods. in fact, [many other countries](https://www.news18.com/elections/narendra-modis-india-controlled-post-covid-inflation-better-than-bidens-us-melonis-italy-or-trudeaus-canada-study-8908042.html), both developing and developed, saw much worse inflation during the covid-19 pandemic than india did. annual inflation (cpi) is stable at 4-5%, which is a significant improvement over what was seen in the 1990s.

ok, i know what you’re thinking,  ‘yes the economy is growing, but it is massively unequal!!’ since economic liberalization, the wealth inequality in india has exploded. [1%](https://www.yahoo.com/news/rich-indians-own-40-wealth-023000805.html) of the wealthiest indians own 40% of the wealth. however, higher inequality doesn’t mean the poor are worse off than before, in fact, they are significantly better off. the percentage of rural households owning motorcycles rose from 9% in 2001 to over 55% in [2022](https://www.dataforindia.com/vehicle-ownership/). non-food items are taking a [larger](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/india-household-spending-non-food-155924380.html) share of household budgets in both rural and urban india. a significantly higher percentage of poor children are now enrolled in school compared to before.the gini coefficient, (consumption data not wealth), has decreased in both rural and urban areas between 2022-25.

‘ok, but there are so many indians moving abroad for school/work!!!’. india is ranked the 100th worse in terms of [brain drain](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/human_flight_brain_drain_index/), with 75 countries being better than india. also, indian students studying abroad is not inherently ""bad” for india. 3.52% of the indian gdp is remittances, over $129 billion every year. indian students are facing increasing difficulty due to tightening visa restrictions, increased costs, and rising hostility and anti-indian sentiment. there is also an increasing number of students coming to study in india: [72,218](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/foreign-students-in-india-at-record-high-after-covid-tumble/articleshow/115951966.cms) international students, 12.84% increase from 2023-24 to 2024-25.

both the bjp and congress have contributed to this remarkable growth which india has been experiencing post 1991.  do i think india has problems? yes, more problems than most countries. but i also love my country. i have spent almost every summer there since i was a young child and i am able to see the growth that is reflected in these statistics. let’s hope india enjoys 30 more years of this growth. #indiasuperpower2050unironically :)

reddit,2025-07-23 19:58:59,"internalized homeopathy &gt;this is just me sharing my own experience &amp; thoughts. if you have gone through something similar, feel free to share your experience in the comments down below.


i think one of the most.... jarring experiences in my life was when i told one of my best friends that i believed homeopathy is a scam, only for him to get really emotional and angry about it.

he later told me his mom was a homeopathic doctor.

it was at that moment i shut the hell up coz that wasn't a line i wanted to cross.

but i'd be a bad friend if i'd lie to him about how i honestly felt (coz he relies on me being honest to him as a friend), so i said ""let's agree to disagree"" and i never brought it up again.

him and his family has always been really kind to me. infact, i've practically been treated as family by them.

which is why this experience left me feeling confused.

worse still, it would not be the only time i had to stand down coz a friend of mine came from a family that practiced homeopathy.

i can see how indirectly calling someone's mother or father a ```delusional sociopath``` can be seen as offensive.... but what the hell should i say instead? 

and before you answer that, let me ask you something first. what was the last time you went to a homeopathic doctor and asked ""hey, what exactly are you putting in these pills? and why should i expect it to help me?"".

i bet most people don't even know homeopathy isn't desi, and was made up by some germen dude back when people still believed draining people's blood will cure diseases.

nor would most people know that homeopathy involves taking a toxic substance that have the same symptoms as your illness, diluting it in water or alcohol till non of the original substance remains (infact they believe the more the diluting, the stronger the medicin, as if their brain went out for a walk or something), and then selling suger balls soaked in alcohol for 500 to upto 3000 rupees while the patient is endlessly suffering and feeling awful for being a financial burden on their family.

worse still are the people who know all this and say ""but it fixed my xyz illness after i took homeopathic medicine"". 

i still take a shit even when i have a feaver and eventually the feaver goes away; so are you going to now also say that taking a shit cures the commen fucking god damn cold?

and it's not poor people who usually engage in such mental gymnastics. it's mostly rich and educated people who will have their whole world view broken if they have to accept that people who they trusted the most, saw as their friends or family, and who they felt would never betray them ... are running a scam.

and you know what's the worse part? it's not even like most homeopathic doctors know they are running a scam. they have the same problem but one level up with their parents taking them to homeopathic doctors and their friends and mentors being into homeopathy.

...... it's insidious..... and i'm not saying people should go to their friends or family who practice homeopathy and tell them they are awful people.... but it's doing real damage to real people in the real world, and the least you can do is atleast stand your ground about what you actually believe in instead of lying.... coz it's this cycle of lying to prevent hurt feelings that keeps homeopathy alive, and perhaps some hurt feelings over agreeing to disagree is worth it if it saves the life of someone out there.

coz otherwise you might end up learning the hard way,...that the path to hell is paved with nothing but good intentions."

the internet freedom foundation (‘iff’) has submitted its objections to the department of telecommunications’ draft interception (amendment) rules, 2025 and cyber security (amendment) rules, 2025. these rules expand government surveillance powers to track and disconnect devices, and could bring a wide range of digital services, including ott platforms, under telecom-style regulation, all without judicial oversight or user notification. iff urges a thorough review to align these rules with constitutional safeguards and protect user rights.



**why should you care?**

your phone is much more than a device: it’s how you access bank accounts, and speak your mind. if the government can quietly collect data about your usage or cut off your access entirely, without going to a judge or even informing you, the risk to your privacy and fundamental freedoms is real and immediate. these expanded powers could now apply not just to phone companies, but to the digital services you use every day, from streaming platforms to online marketplaces.



**background: the new draft amendments and their collective effect**



in june 2025, the ministry of communications published two amendments for public input: the telecommunications (procedures and safeguards for lawful interception of messages) amendment rules, 2025, (‘interception rules, 2025’) and the telecommunications (telecom cyber security) amendment rules, 2025 (‘cyber security rules, 2025’). these proposals aim to boost cybersecurity but they also widen the government’s reach, allowing it to collect and analyze “traffic data” from nearly any platform that uses telecom identifiers, potentially sweeping in ott and online platforms as “telecommunication identifier user entities” (tiues). this is a sharp shift, especially since mr. ashwini vaishnav, the minister of communications, had earlier promised that otts wouldn’t fall under the telecom act. the draft rules go beyond standard telecom operators. they extend surveillance and control to platforms that were never meant to be regulated like telecoms, raising questions of proportionality and whether such a move is even legal under the parent statute.

**our submissions and concerns**

on july 18, iff sent its detailed submission to the department of telecommunications, highlighting problems:

* overbroad application: the definition of tiues includes a person, other than a licensee or authorised entity, which uses telecommunication identifiers for the identification of its customers or users, or for provisioning and delivery of services. this could bring ott and digital platforms into telecom regulation, despite previous government assurances, and with no clear link to the aims set out in the act.  
* lack of judicial oversight: these rules enable the government to collect your user data, metadata, and even disconnect your sim or device on grounds of ‘public interest’. there is no requirement for a judge or an independent authority to sign off on such actions: the process exists in an executive echo chamber. where review committees do exist, they consist solely of top government officials judging the legality of their own actions, violating basic fairness and separation of powers principles.  
* no user notification, no effective remedy: individuals affected will likely never know this power has been used—and without notification, they have no way to seek judicial review or redress for violations of speech and privacy rights under articles 19(1)(a) and 21 of the constitution. moreover, since mobile devices act as a conduit for a person’s speech and expression, as well as their right to know, access may only be restricted on the specific grounds laid out in article 19(2). the current rules allow device disconnection if deemed expedient in the public interest, a justification the constitution does not recognize.

iff has, therefore, called for:

* restricting the ambit of tiues so that only licensed telecom operators are held to these standards instead of all digital platforms that rely on telecom identifiers.  
* introducing independent and judicial oversight for any surveillance or device disconnection orders via review committees chaired by former judges of the supreme court or high courts.  
* ensuring users receive notification and a written order to ensure judicial remedies if their rights are impacted.

iff has also proposed alternate language for the rules in its submission to the department."

tuesday a red i10 broke down while i was traveling, it caused a jam where the flyover merges with the traffic coming from btm.

wednesday, a final destination like truck with wooden logs broke down right after entering from ragigudda, causing a long slow moving traffic. 

today, was even worse. i was travelling at around 40 - 50kmph, there was a bbmp auto in the left lane broken down/parked just below a metro station. zero visibility as the metro station blocks 90% of the sunlight, there's no street lights on that section, and there's this abandoned bbmp auto without any warnings light or reflectors placed a few meters away.

luckily i was able to spot it from a distance and slowed down, but people were overtaking me from the right lane, it was getting scary and difficult to avoid the abandoned auto without breaking too hard, as many vehicles were tailgating me. 

i had no option but to slowdown praying someone won't rear end me (i'm on a scooter), somehow the rider behind me breaked hard, could hear his tyres screech and i successfully avoided the auto. 

i was so mad and pissed that the bbmp auto travels before abandoning never thought that its under a poorly lit section on a flyover."

this is follow up, on my last viral-post, where i committed to put 1 crore and my time on bangalore traffic

1 collaboration at scale

in just 10 days, after meeting the commissioners of btp, bbmp, cp, google team, iisc professors, scientist, road engineers, traffic related entrepreneurs. i am confident of improving bangalore traffic by 25-30% within a year's time. all three newly appointed commissioners were very kind to invite me to showcase existing capabilities and collaborate to work together. for the first time we are bringing all key public and private players - to the same table.

---

2 quick optimization projects

a) bangalore traffic simulators
both btp and iisc have simulation models, which can create millions of re-routing permutations to reduce travel-time (not shortest distance). i have requested the data from google, uber, ola, rapido, that will make models predict better re-routing. some of them have confirmed to help. waiting for others. if the model starts working, we will be able to predict where/when gridlock is going to happen, so we can fix it before it occurs. 

b) fixing feedback loop
govt already has apps, where people can report potholes. i will take ownership of that app, to increase its scope (report illegal parking, broken signal, wrong side driving, water logging, broken vehicle, etc). i will also increase accountability and recognition by showcasing all the complaints lodged and action-taken (along with time-stamp) publicly.

c) hyperlocal rain predictor
govt closes the road to do infra/maintenance work, but then it starts raining on that patch of road and work halts. this leads to crazy downtime and traffic congestion. hyperlocal rain predictor project will also allow to fix drainage issue even before it happens.

d) green wave signals: putting traffic lights in sync, so they move vehicles in waves, instead of stopping at every junction. a pilot is already happening, we will analyse the results to see if it makes sense to be done at city level.

3 the vision for india

many people mentioned in my last post ""bangalore traffic is an infra problem"", congrats on stating the obvious. if we continue to wait for infra to become better, then we are merely playing a catch-up game with the west. there is so much scope to optimize current infra, and i would rather focus on that. this is no longer about rants or blaming the system. it’s about practical optimism - believing that with data, intent, and collaboration, we can improve what feels unfixable.

reddit,2025-07-26 18:10:07,"the scourge of extra fees - convenience/ packaging / transaction/ cash handling! it is just getting murkier. online transactions were all about convenience and savings. however it seems the vendors are feeling wolfish and aren't just satisfied with receiving money for the services they provide. instead they are turning over the transaction costs of the payments mechanism to the customers.

if you order from subway online, they charge like 25 bucks for packaging. isn't the packaging the same as when you go to a store and order a sub? why don't they charge you this fees there? when you order some food online through one of the delivery apps, every pizza chain is charging packaging fees. have you heard of a pizza ever coming in any other way besides the box? if you go order it in store, they'd still pack it in the same box and yet not charge anything extra. if you go dine in a restaurant, you are using their resources including wait staff, furniture, electricity etc and you don't get charged extra fees. yet when you order it online, they slap you with packaging fee. if anything they should be discounting it as the customers are not using the expensive resources. 

i just paid for my kids school online, using a credit card and they slapped in a 1% convenience fees. the credit card fees , the onus of which earlier used to be on the vendor, is now moved on to the customer. shouldn't that be part of your cost? if not, why not add electrical fees, toilet fees, cleaning fees, education fees etc to the tally?

you book a ticket on the indigo app, they want 500-700 as convenience fees.  
you book a ticket on book my show, they slap a hefty fee on you when infact they do get a commission from the movies theatres for getting them business. 

the mantra these days is just add whatever you can as customers will not notice or will not complain as it's a paltry sum of money.

zomato started this ridiculous trend and i think this fee was the biggest contributor for them in their topline, as if getting 35% of the order value from restaurants was not enough.

even amazon could not stay out without tasting this mouth watering treat. 5 bucks an order. wow, when you take 1500 a year to sign for prime membership, why should there be another fee. nowhere in the world amazon can dare to charge this but they are having a free hit in india.

the whole system got infected after one was able to pass it on.

reddit,2025-07-27 19:21:59,"cma vs cpa. what should i choose next? hi everyone,

i’m currently finishing my bachelor of commerce in finance and taxation, and i’m feeling stuck between choosing cma (usa) or cpa (usa) for my next move.

my career goals:

1. i want to work in finance-related roles, not pure accounting
2. my interests lie in financial planning &amp; analysis (fp&amp;a), corporate strategy, and management-level decision-making. 
3. long-term, i’d love to grow into a strategic finance role, like a finance business partner, cfo, or corporate planner


here’s where i’m conflicted:

i know that cma (usa) aligns perfectly with what i want to do — it focuses on management accounting, budgeting, decision support, and fp&amp;a. the course is faster, more focused, and seems well-suited to corporate roles.

but the problem is… very few people seem to know what cma is, especially outside finance departments. i’m worried that if i do cma, i’ll always have to explain it to recruiters and hiring managers. cpa, on the other hand, is globally recognized and commands respect right away, even if it leans more toward audit and taxation, which i’m not as interested in. 

and also from what i’ve seen on job boards and linkedin, many financial analyst or fp&amp;a job listings still ask for a cpa, even when the role is clearly more finance-oriented than accounting-heavy.

what i want to know:
1. is cma actually well-recognized and respected in corporate finance roles like fp&amp;a. 

2. will i be at a disadvantage if i do cma and skip cpa especially when i want to work in strategic finance roles rather than traditional accounting?

3. is it worth doing cpa just for the brand recognition, even if the content doesn’t align with my goals?

4. has anyone here chosen cma and faced challenges with recognition in hiring?

i’d really appreciate honest feedback from anyone who’s been down this road. i don’t want to make a decision based on fear of obscurity or just go with the more popular option if it’s not aligned with my career goals.

thanks so much in advance 🙏"

so, i got my gst certificate done for my it firm back in feb 2021 - i consulted a ca firm to get things done, which covers bank account opening, gst, import / export, company pan, company registry, etc. - for all of these, i end-up paying in total of inr 10,000 to the ca firm, which covers all the relevant fees and expenses towards gst, import / export, notary / stamp papers, etc. i didn't faced any bribery and neither had any jack (someone known in the department), for me the process was extreme smooth. 

till now, i.e., till i read today's post, i was under the impression that there isn't anything is bribe when it comes to gst &amp; stuff. likewise few of my friends or other business ventures whom i met, they too never faced such thing. i am not taking this as a good sign, i take it as normal, thinking/ under the impression that its like typical government process where you pay the fees (not bribe) follow the proceduere, submit docs, and get the things done. for e.g., i had to increase the voltage and phases of my home's electricity meter, which too was done with regular fees charges and process, no bribe here too. 

so its kinda like shockingly weird that there have been case of bribery in this.

reddit,2025-07-30 02:02:22,"harrasment by cops on couples so, this happened recently and it still bothers me every day.

one fine evening, me and my girlfriend had just come back from a trip with friends. after reaching our area (nandini layout), we stopped at a food stall to have some chats to eat. then we left to go home, and it suddenly started raining — so we had to stop on a road (which apparently they call the ""officials area"").

because of the rain and the trek i did all day, i got a serious cramp in my leg and was trying to stretch it out. suddenly, a cop stopped by and asked, “what are you doing?” — and without even waiting, he started checking my pockets saying, ""thegi, gaanja aache"" (basically: “take out the stuff,” iykyk).

i told him, “check everything, sir. i don’t even smoke — why the hell would i do dr**gs?”
at this point, he hadn’t even noticed my girlfriend because it was dark, raining, and there was a power cut. i was standing a bit away from her.

then he told me to come with him for a medical checkup to prove i’m not on dr**gs.
i tried to explain: “sir, me and my girlfriend were just coming back from a trip. it started raining so we stopped here.”

then he started a whole new drama: “oh you guys are out at this time? (it was just around 7 pm) do your parents know? call your parents. let’s go to the station.”
i asked, “what did i do?”
he replied, “i know everything you guys do.”
funny part? we were literally meters away from each other when he stopped us. no pda, nothing.

at one point, he even started questioning us like, “why the hell do you guys even come to the officials area?”
i mean, is it a restricted place? isn’t it just a normal public road? we were literally just standing there because it started raining.


then my girlfriend started crying — a lot. i tried to calm her down and told her to just leave, i’ll handle it. but then he threatened: “if she leaves, i’ll call the hoysala (patrol car) and lock you in a dr**gs case.”
she got terrified and stayed, crying.

i kept pleading: “we didn’t do anything, please let us go.”
he grabbed my t-shirt so hard, i said, “sir, please leave my shirt.”
instead, he gripped it even tighter.
when i tried to free his hand, he slapped me so hard. “oh, you raised your hand on a policeman in uniform? you’re going to jail for sure.”
then he slapped me two more times, broke my metal watch, snatched my phone, forced me to unlock it, checked my gallery, and saw trek photos of us.

then he forced me to come to the station and call our parents. i kept insisting we didn’t do anything.
then he changed his tune: “okay, come to the station and pay the fine.”
i asked, “fine for what? we didn’t do anything.”
he said, “you raised your hand on a cop, etc. etc.”

i said, “no, i’m not coming to the station.”
all this while, my girlfriend was crying heavily but stood by me. i even tried to explain to him, “we’ve been in a relationship since childhood — 8 years. please don’t do this.”

then he said, “okay, give me the fine here and you can go.”
i asked how much.
he said, “₹10,000.”
i straight-up disagreed — it wasn’t possible.

all through this, i kept begging him to leave the girl; i said, “take me to the station if you want, but leave her.”
then he said, “₹5,000 will do.”
still too much, so i said, “i’ll give everything i have, but that’s it.”
the cash i had was in my girlfriend’s bag. i told her to give it, and she pulled out around ₹2,000.
she even tried to drop a ₹500 note to pick it up later, but he saw and asked for that too.
he took photos of both of us, even though she begged him not to, and took a photo of my two-wheeler. then finally, he left.


we both are born and brought up in bangalore, native to this city — yet we had to face something like this in our own area.
this whole thing was such a trauma for both of us.
we even stopped going on trips after that, thinking: if this could happen in a busy area inside the city, what if something like this happened while we were on a trek or somewhere remote where hardly anyone’s around?

i’m even thinking of turning this story into a short film, since i’m mostly into cinema.

reddit,2025-08-01 17:45:35,"indians have destroyed the image of india in foreign the post will probably be taken down for telling the truth.

as an indian living overseas, i can understand the rationale behind the widespread resentment that indians currently face, with the exception of islamic nations.

most foreigners don't/can't understand india as a diverse country, as no country is as diverse as india. arguably, north/south/east india has almost nothing in common.

during the british era, only certain sections of indians tended to go out of india.... the people who were highly educated and civilised ...scientists, literary giants, classical musicians, people who took the actual yoga to the west (not the crap sad-guru and kamdev shit). they were highly respected everywhere, even though india was a colony...the trend continued till the seventies, eighties.

the it boom and thanks to central government policies, certain sections of indians started immigrating in mass to western countries .... unfortunately, such communities are historically devoid of any actual culture, intelligence, and lack basic civility for thousands of years.

the large-scale influx of uncultured individuals from specific regions of india is to blame for the destruction of india's reputation, which has reduced indians to workers in occupations that ordinary people in other nations don't want to perform. but that's not the only problem.  however, that's not the only issue.

here's the behaviour i have generally seen ....

1. **public cursing**: cursing is sometimes common in a large group of indians in different languages, as they think foreigners will not understand, and they will get away with it. i have heard cursing in public in supermarkets, libraries, universities, and professional workplaces.  indian professors have even admitted to observing this behavior in their indian pupils.
2. **claiming fake asylum**: this is dragging the indian passport and the country's image to the ground. i have personally seen loads of indians doing it. they assert that the indian government is attempting to prosecute them because they identify as lgbtq or something else. my friend liz was discussing one of these just yesterday. a south indian man attempted to persuade her to write a letter of support for him because he is gay and seeking asylum, but she refused. the guy was hitting on her forever and still does.
3. **creeping on foreign women(or even on men from indian women)**: you can be attracted to anyone, but you have to take fundamental etiquette, rules, and respect into account. desperation for sex or residencies is not okay ....they are also human beings. i have seen men taking pride in crpping women out (iit educated guy), an indian girl pressuring their boyfriends for a hasty marriage to settle. then you see the 5000 for russians is common talk among north indians.
4. **nepotism:** now, although it's common for every community/country, it hampers the integration and creativity in the workplace.
5. **being dirty**: you can cook indian food at home and still not smell like it if you put in an effort. basic hygiene standards must be followed either in india or abroad. every time i searched for housing and went to see a place that indians previously/currently occupied, it was a disaster. smelly, dirty, unclear food plates, ovens, and hobs that never get any cleaning, unkempt rooms, so so much more to describe. i'm not sure why, even in india, my parents instilled in me the value of cleaning up after myself, and i've worked hard to maintain every location i've lived incredibly fresh and clean.

such behaviours turn everyone against indians, and now, if they find out a decent indian, most people can't fathom how that's even possible. i recall one of the indian professors at uni was voluntarily talking about his phd in a top uni in canada, and how indians ruined the atmosphere and incited canadians to oppose indians. then there's the top brass of power-hungry indians supporting anti-vaxxers, anti-women ideologies, casteism in a foreign land, promoting vegan cultism, blocking roads to celebrate religious/cultural festivals, and so much more.

most indians try to switch to indian languages if they see another indian person, even if the others are foreigners and can't understand them. that's bullshit. westerners always apologize, try not to speak in a different language while in a mix of people.

indians need to understand that just because you are from india, that doesn't make you entitled to behave like my closest friend from the very first meet.

edit: to the idiotic baffons who make everything about caste. let me tell you, india is larger than regressive casteist spheres. i always had friends from all castes and religions. we ate together, shared the same plates, and everything else like regular human beings.

learning basic civility, being cultured isn't that hard. the majority of typical indian ghetto behaviours are by gujrati, punjabi, harianvi, delhi, telegu, and extended cow belts. a few years back, i remember a few australian universities partially banned students from certain indian states.

if you aren't a complete idiot, you would have understood that certain actions create resentment and propagate negative stereotypes. after a while, that resentment turns to violence. that's why these days, even random attacks against indians are becoming common, not that i am supporting it.

 the majority of you don't even read history properly. one of the distinguished freedom fighters, bipin chandra pal (lal-bal-pal), once said,"" sadly, we want political freedom from the british, but when it comes to social values and reform, we have to look up to them"". unfortuanaly that's the reality of india, people care about education, get educated, earn money, but fail to become civilised on a large scale. 

rape is a big problem in india, which also hampers india's image on a global scale and makes women's lives miserable.  every dimwit wants to get stricter punishments, which is redundant as it will never solve the problem.,but don't want naturalised relationships between men-women n india from very early stages of life. apparently it will ruin "" typical indian social values"", and indoctrinations to the ""great"" 2000-year-old culture."

reddit,2025-08-03 14:55:29,"why is there such a massive quality difference in products between the west and india? after living in the us for eight years and moving back to india four years ago, the massive difference in product quality i see in everyday life is impossible to ignore and it bothers me.

the contrast is everywhere. it’s in the most basic things, like garbage bags that are flimsy and tear too easily, and in expensive, branded clothes that don't hold up after a few washes. we have supermarkets like d-mart and reliance, but they are nowhere near the quality or selection of a walmart - a store considered to be for the poor in the west - let alone a target or dillons.

the difference is more frustrating with major purchases. take cars, for example. the vehicles sold as premium here, with luxury car-level gst, are actually quite affordable in the us. and even then, they still can't match the quality of their american counterparts in the same segment.  electronics, such as tv or its accessories don't last long. 

in summary, you may buy premium products in india, but you won't get the quality of the standard product in the west.

i think this an issue of planned obsolescence, where things are simply not built to last. i know companies have different manufacturing standards for various markets. we often joke that chinese products don't last, but i've heard that's because they produce low-quality goods specifically for certain markets, while making high-quality products for the west. i've also heard people suggest that brands sell their lower-tier or ""rejected"" products from west in india, which is a frustrating thought.

this makes me wonder: why no startups focus on such a gap in the market? this is a huge opportunity for anyone with capital."

there are few street dogs in my area (kudlu) causing trouble. these dogs are always barking and fighting amongst each other causing a lot of disturbance. there are several times i’ve observed these dogs chasing and barking at people passing by, often startling and scaring them. when i move around, they are usually friendly with me but i have seen them chasing people who may easily get frightened by stray dogs. 

they also constantly bark and fight throughout the night around 12-3am and this is making me go insane. i’ve started wearing earplugs to sleep but want to make sure these dogs are moved somewhere safe. 

i raised a complaint on the bbmp sahaya portal and spoke with a bbmp official today. that conversation went nowhere and he quickly dismissed it as an incorrect area and was annoyed that i wasn’t specific with my area. i mentioned my area and a few surrounding areas to help them identify but he still didn’t respond positively. 

i checked my complaint on the portal and it has assigned my complaint to a wrong location. i don’t remember having to input an address while complaining and it clearly shows my correct address on the website.

what can i do here? is it worth raising a complaint once again and try to get it assigned to the right ward or are there any other organisations i can contact instead?

tldr: i'm dealing with a pack of stray dogs in my neighborhood that are constantly barking, fighting, and chasing people. it's gotten so bad that i'm losing sleep and have to wear earplugs. i tried to report the issue to the bbmp sahaya portal, but my complaint was assigned to the wrong location, and a bbmp official was unhelpful when i called. now i'm wondering if i should file another complaint or if there are other organizations i can reach out to for help."

reddit,2025-08-07 12:22:12,"tracking poshan, excluding workers? # tl;dr

the ministry of women and child development is mandating verification through facial recognition technology in the distribution of essential rations. the tech’s failures and overreach has caused distress amongst anganwadi workers as well as the beneficiaries themselves. we filed an rti with the ministry seeking information on the legal basis of instituting facial recognition in welfare distribution through the poshan tracker app, and the safeguards in place to ensure non-exclusion in the face of technical errors.

# why should you care?

technology, while seen as a good, can have adverse effects on inclusion especially when implemented ineffectively. india’s digital divide is a well documented reality. 

in the case of the poshan tracker, the beneficiaries experience a multi-layer intersectional digital divide due to their overlapping socio-economic identities. india’s inchoate digital welfare regime therefore poses real and immediate threats of exclusion, and this exclusion comes without any grievance redressal mechanism. this can lead to lower percolation of welfare benefits as deserving candidates start opting out of the distribution process for reasons such as authentication failures, inaccessibility of digital devices and/or biometric documentation etc.

# background

welfare delivery in modern nation-states is increasingly shifting to digital platforms that rely on biometric and data-driven authentication, aiming to minimize leakage and streamline the distribution of benefits. india is embracing this transformation with state-level programmes that rely on what is called ‘[entity resolution](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2024/04/entity-resolution-in-indias-welfare-digitalization/)’, where governments establish digital platforms and databases through which welfare benefits are accrued. for example, madhya pradesh’s [samagra portal](https://samagra.gov.in/public/staticpages/aboutsamagra.aspx) consolidates multiple welfare databases related to pensions, food security, and scholarships to vulnerable groups  into a single digital platform. haryana’s [saral portal](https://saralharyana.gov.in/) offers citizens a unified digital interface to access, apply for, and track over 600 schemes and services across government departments. telangana’s [samagra vedika](https://it.telangana.gov.in/initiatives/electronic-services-delivery/) creates digital profiles for every citizen by integrating government databases across diverse schemes like pensions and subsidized housing. 

this is the result of a [techno-solutionist](https://archive.org/details/tosaveeverything0000moro) paradigm, where the introduction and deployment of technology is viewed as a necessary good that can ‘solve everything’. however, this worldview in the context of welfare distribution is the result of its own politics where liberal nation states are increasingly being ruled by a narrative of wastage in welfare distribution, with many populist movements [advocating](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spsr.12428) for the cutting of state-aid measures and decreasing what is called ‘welfare fraud’. moreover, new technologies [routinely](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/1/24/how-an-algorithm-denied-food-to-thousands-of-poor-in-indias-telangana) result in exclusion of vulnerable groups due to gaps, errors and failures.

a fresh example of a measure aimed to reduce such fraud is the ministry of women and child development’s directive to use facial recognition systems (frs) in the distribution of rations under the integrated child development services (icds) scheme. under the icds, pregnant and lactating women, as well as children aged 6 months to 3 years are provided with essential services [like](https://www.pib.gov.in/pressreleaseshare.aspx?prid=1784152#:~:text=under%20anganwadi%20services%2c%20a%20package,age%20group%20of%200%2d6) supplementary nutrition, preschool education, regular health check-ups, immunisations, and nutrition and health education. the facial recognition technology deployed requires liveness detection, a technology used for verifying if a biometric sample, such as a face, belongs to a real living person. this measure has been introduced despite the supreme court’s orders in the ‘right to food’ case (pucl v. union of india, w.p. 196 of 2001) that state that every child under six years of age, every pregnant and lactating woman and every adolescent girl is entitled to all services of the icds. supplementary nutrition under icds, through the anganwadi centres, is also a legal entitlement under the [national food security act](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/2113?view_type=browse). 

the rethink aadhar campaign’s [statement](https://rethinkaadhaar.in/blog/2025/7/10/right-to-food-stop-exclusionary-facial-recognition-mandate-in-nutrition-schemes) on the new measure summarises the issues with it succinctly: 

&gt;“towards meeting these obligations, the services of icds are legally mandated to be accessible to the target groups without any mandatory requirements like residence proof, aadhaar etc. just the mere presence of a young child or a pregnant/lactating woman at an anganwadi centre is enough for them to be given supplementary nutrition. the facial recognition mandate, however, turns this right into a conditional privilege, contingent on access to smartphones , internet connectivity, functioning apps, and correct aadhaar-linked numbers—none of which are guaranteed for most marginalised families accessing the service.”

&gt;— rethink aadhaar (@no2uid) [july 15, 2025](https://twitter.com/no2uid/status/1945123526987448659?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw)

# exclusion due to frs in poshan tracker

the ministry [claims](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/food/mandatory-facial-recognition-for-womens-nutrition-scheme-sparks-fears-of-exclusion-and-tech-failures) that frs would curb corruption and improve transparency. however, reportage from news media outlets has showcased the exclusionary effect brought on by the new frs mandate: anganwadi workers are [reporting](https://www.thenewsminute.com/news/facial-recognition-on-poshan-app-anganwadi-workers-and-activists-fear-exclusion-privacy-risks) consistent technical failures brought on not just by the technology but also by the requirement to possess aadhar-linked mobile numbers to receive otps. the systems are struggling to reconcile differences in appearance between the photographs on record and people’s current faces, resulting in continuous authentication errors. all this is to ensure that a packet of raw food does not reach the wrong hands. the system results in a self-exclusionary phenomenon, where beneficiaries do not avail welfare services on account of the difficulty and barriers faced in accessing them. frs and its technical failures also put undue burden on the already overworked anganwadi workers, who are now [tasked](https://www.thenewsminute.com/news/facial-recognition-on-poshan-app-anganwadi-workers-and-activists-fear-exclusion-privacy-risks) with explaining the nuances and implications of the jargon-laden privacy policy to beneficiaries. in the face of mass digital [illiteracy](https://d1ns4ht6ytuzzo.cloudfront.net/oxfamdata/oxfamdatapublic/2022-12/digital%20divide_india%20inequality%20report%202022_print%20with%20cropmarks.pdf?3l.73pgqrpqfyrnwweoxv3bfjhetfa_p) in the poorest indian households, this means that data is being collected with no real consent while holding hostage essential welfare benefits.

going beyond the known failures of facial recognition technology such as its unreliability when it comes to people of colour or its inability to recognise natural progression in a person’s appearance based on factors such as pregnancy or medical conditions, there exists a link between the growing digitisation of welfare distribution and the modern nation-state’s interest in data collection of its citizenry. 

this is evidenced by the [privacy policy](https://www.poshantracker.in/privacypolicy) for the poshan tracker. when an individual creates an account to avail the services provided by poshan tracker, a considerable amount of their personal data is collected under clause 1.1, including their name, mobile number, date of birth, gender, name of their children, aadhar number, address and ‘facial image’. despite having access to such sensitive data, the poshan tracker’s privacy policy is vague. it fails to clarify the duration for which the user’s data will be stored, stating that the data will be stored for a ‘reasonable time’ after use under clause 5(d). in addition, the application allows for unnecessary location tracking, stating that it may use gps or similar technologies to determine the user’s current location (clause 1.4). however, it provides no explanation for why such precise tracking is necessary. the privacy policy also outlines the automatic collection of a wide array of user’s information, which includes but is not limited to unique device id, ip address, browser type, and user activity. this data which has been collected can then be used for ‘all acts incidental or ancillary to the provision of the system’ under clause 3.5. furthermore, it disclaims all responsibility for the data it shares with third parties as part of its application programming interface (api). the legal disclosure clause in the policy is also vague and devoid of user safeguards. it states that a user’s information may be shared in response to legal requests or subpoenas, or when deemed necessary to investigate fraud, assist law enforcement, or defend against third-party claims (clause 4.1). however, there are no provisions which mandate that the user be notified of the disclosure or have the right to contest the same.

the new mandate also insists on aadhar ekyc linking. in recent years, aadhaar-based identity systems have been increasingly implemented by both union and state government agencies across india to authenticate individuals for access to a wide range of public services. these systems are now widely used in public offices, hospitals, and schools. however, their deployment often lacks sufficient oversight and safeguards, posing significant risks to citizens’ sensitive data and potentially excluding those who lack access to or familiarity with digital technology. this acts as a further barrier to entry for rural women looking to avail benefits under the icds scheme. the ever increasing collection of data must be offset with a competent and expansive data protection regime, which our digital personal data protection act is not. while the government is granted sweeping powers to exempt itself or its instrumentalities from data protection obligations, the act provides no external oversight mechanism to impose checks and balances. instead, concerns have been attempted to be assuaged by assurances of [internal](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/concerns-around-contentious-provisions-of-data-protection-law-mos-it-8889933/) checks.

the implementation of technology in welfare distribution has also had disparate impacts on the intersections of society. the supreme court has noted the exclusionary nature of the ekyc exercise in the case of persons with disabilities and persons from rural communities in [pragya prasun v. union of india](https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/1787920242025-04-30-597958.pdf), where it stated: 

&gt;“*... in the contemporary era, where access to essential services, governance, education, healthcare, and economic opportunities is increasingly mediated through digital platforms, the right to life under article 21 of the constitution must be reinterpreted in light of these technological realities. the digital divide – characterized by unequal access to digital infrastructure, skills, and content – continues to perpetuate systemic exclusion, not only of persons with disabilities, but also of large sections of rural populations, senior citizens, economically weaker communities, and linguistic minorities. the principle of substantive equality demands that digital transformation be both inclusive and equitable… individuals in remote or rural areas often face poor connectivity, limited digital literacy, and a scarcity of content in regional languages, effectively denying them meaningful access to e-governance and welfare delivery systems. in such circumstances, the state’s obligations under article 21– read in conjunction with articles 14, 15 and 38 of the constitution – must encompass the responsibility to ensure that digital infrastructure, government portals, online learning platforms, and financial technologies are universally accessible, inclusive and responsive to the needs of all vulnerable and marginalized populations. bridging the digital divide is no longer merely a matter of policy discretion but has become a constitutional imperative to secure a life of dignity, autonomy and equal participation in public life. the right to digital access, therefore, emerges as an intrinsic component of the right to life and liberty, necessitating that the state proactively design and implement inclusive digital ecosystems that serve not only the privileged but also the marginalized, those who have been historically excluded.*”

# rti by iff

iff filed an rti with the ministry of women and child development looking to gain greater transparency around the frs implementation in the poshan tracker by asking the following questions:

1. please provide a copy of the official notification, circular, or directive mandating the use of facial recognition systems (frs) in the poshan tracker app for distributing welfare benefits under the integrated child development services (icds) scheme and take home ration (thr) program.
2. please supply supporting documents for the legal basis of mandating frs in the delivery of welfare benefits under the integrated child development services (icds) scheme and take home ration (thr) programme.
3. please state whether a public and stakeholder consultation (including feedback from beneficiaries and anganwadi workers) was conducted for the project. if yes, please share copies of the minutes, reports, or summary documents of such consultations.
4. please state whether a privacy impact assessment and a cost-benefit analysis have been conducted for the project. if yes, please share a copy of the report(s).
5. please share the privacy policy that governs the collection, storage, processing and retention of biometric and facial data collected through frs in the poshan tracker.
6. please provide the mou/contract signed between the mowcd and the chosen vendor/technology provider.
7. please state what alternatives are provided for beneficiaries who do not wish to participate in frs authentication for any reason.
8. please state the grievance redressal mechanisms available to beneficiaries and anganwadi workers facing technical issues or exclusion due to frs.
9. please state the security measures in place to secure biometric data from unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse. please provide documentation of any audits or security assessments that have been conducted.
10. are there plans to implement frs authentication across other schemes? if so, kindly provide details.

tech fixes can widen, not close, social gaps when we ignore real-world context. our digital welfare push has skipped over india’s deep, intersectional digital divide, and groups already on the margins like women, people with disabilities, and elderly people are slipping further behind. in the case of women for example, gender disparities in mobile ownership, limited digital literacy, and patriarchal control over access to technology have reduced rather than increased agency, often rendering them more dependent on male kin. in their chapter on digital delivery of welfare systems in india, sivaramakrishnan and pellissery (2023) conclude with: 

&gt;“while the use of digital systems is the future, measures must be taken for a smooth transition, and special attention must be given to factors that increase the vulnerability of groups left behind, such as women, older persons and people with disabilities. novel strategies are needed to improve access for people with low levels of literacy, to overcome the urban bias in provision, and to address social and gender dynamics and other social divisions that serve to exclude people from service access. the need for human interfaces when using digitalisation is another important lesson from the indian experience with digital delivery of welfare programmes.”

all of us at iff acknowledge these learnings and will continue advocating for the use of technology as an enabler rather than a challenge to our rights under the constitution of india. this means, beyond this rti (which we hope reveals answers and if not, we are prepared to contest a refusal), we will continue examining avenues to challenge technological fetters on our welfare services.

i wanted to ask:

* is there an official way to report this to the bangalore city corporation?
* does the bcc have any helpline or whatsapp number for complaints?
* is there an official mobile app or website where i can raise a request or share pictures?
* if you've done this before, how effective was the response?

i've been thinking about all the posts we see here about local problems—potholes, garbage, traffic issues, you name it. we vent, we share photos, but a lot of the time, it feels like these issues just get ignored by the authorities.

what if we tried a new approach? instead of just posting here, what if we used this subreddit to amplify our voices where it really matters?

here's the idea:
let's create a single thread where people can post links to their tweets about local problems. this way, we can all rally together as a community to retweet and like these posts, giving them a massive public response. when a tweet goes viral or gets a lot of traction, it's much harder for officials to ignore.


edit: let's start posting the link of your post of your problem of your locality under this post so that people can actually help you , please spare 10 sec to just retweet maybe it really help i don't think we need a viral post to reach authorities and solve small problems right maybe a few hands will help and also there is a website called itsmybengaluru.com which will pick up you links and post it on their website too which will help us even more. let's hope everyone helps each other and we get some results out of it."

to be very honest, i had been an andhbhakt. reels and media corrupted my mind and i started defending india whenever people on social media trolled our country for shitting everywhere and ample garbage, by citing gdp, growth rate and pointing it to a population problem. only when i started vacationing abroad like europe or se asia was when i realised how are we being fooled. once specific instance was when i was on a flixbus from ams to paris and i did not even see a single wrapper. that's how clean the entire journey was. even for places like phuket, which does not have world class infra but still has a lot of tourists just because its clean.  india has much better tourism but no civic sense or cleanliness and i saw a live example when my us friend had visited. 

i was honestly so ashamed. 

  
after she left, i decided to make change. i know we can raise issues to the municipals, social media but all that takes time and rarely effective in india. plus, getting beaten and threats by local politicians if you start protests.  

  
i was fired up. i wanted to make a visible change asap. i started touring around my neighbourhood looking for spots to clean but the main problem was right there. there was a large pothole where vehicles always had a hard time, around the intersection. the largest pothole of them all. plus there was garbage pileup right next to the pavement beside it. i chose that spot. 

  
look, i was all fired up but deep down i was still hesitant to clean it myself. i earn well, an swe and cleaning garbage or road?? too low for me. but my us friend's visible face reaction crossed my mind as soon as i had such thoughts. so, i decided to finally do it myself, around at midnight since there'd be less traffic plus a part of me still didn't want my neighbours to see me doing this. 

  
around noon, i started scouring for materials. i came across bitumen and asphalt from online research. bought an approx 5kg of cold mix asphalt from one of my friends in construction. some flower pots and paint with brushes. got a shovel and large plastic bags for garbage collection. prepared a plan on how to successfully do it. 

at 1am, started with collecting garbage. it had the worst smell and i already started feeling nauseous after 5mins. i didn't have the best shovel but i managed it anyways. i took some breaks in between and i managed to clean most of them, except some stubborn stuck to the surface. i used water to chafe it off after a lot of hassle, and finally managed to finish it. 4 garbage bags. sprayed some chuna and got to pothole repairing. 

first drained any remaining water and let dry it for a bit. got back to garbage meanwhile planted flower pots to enhance beauty. use some paint for pavement, creating that black white design for final finishes. it was definitely looking better. i then returned to the pothole and poured the cold asphalt (hot is better though) and tried to spread it evenly. but the surface was not levelled, so i had to remove the entire asphalt first and added some granular stones (like you see near railways tracks, youtube zindabaad!) first and then laid the asphalt. worked well. but the shovel was not really doing a good job in making it even so i called one of my friends who had a car to run it over the surface. pothole was fixed. learnt a ton. but hey, that was not such a tough job?? doable once you get a grip. 

  
anyways, i started receiving a lot of messages on my wa at morning since my friend's (who had a car) mother spread the word and people were ready to contribute. they were extremely happy and ready to contribute in any way. already got 2 college volunteers and around rs.3500 in donation from happy uncles and aunts. next weekend, more  to fix! really excited and happy. i am not ashamed to pick up garbage anymore!!!

  
to conclude this, i would just say : people in india want a change and they are ready to put efforts or atleast help people who are trying to do so if they are hesitant themselves as evident from volunteers and donations.

i learnt that i can actually start contributing instead of just bickering about the govt or municipal which don't give a shit at all. but i applaud people who organise protests, run social media campaigns against corrupt officials and doing anything for the country on a mass level. hopefully i will get there someday. baby steps right now.  i am not a huge gandhi fan but i truly understood the meaning of ""be the change you wish to see in the world"" now.

the drainage was blocked for days, and when repair work finally started, they dug everything up and dumped all the muck on the already filthy footpath. that path is now just a mix of dirt, dust, and obstacles.

to make matters worse, the aet junction on this route is a traffic nightmare — it takes forever to get through. walking here feels like going through a dust tornado, and i can’t imagine how much we’re inhaling daily. the footpaths are crooked, taken over by street vendors or parked delivery bikes, so pedestrians are left with no real space.

reddit,2025-08-10 10:19:25,"so things can be much better with proper enforcement? i was honestly surprised this weekend in electronic city - traffic seemed much more organised, fewer stray cattle/dogs on the streets, no power cuts (which is rare here), and even the infamous dumping spots (""black spots"") were cleared. roads were freshly painted and things just felt... well, in control.

i might be imagining it, but did they actually do something about the strays too? or is this just a coincidence? also the traffic seemed pretty much in control although there was longer wait times. which i think is okay considering there were no 2 wheelers coming right into my face on the wrong side at every corner.

all this for a project that's been delayed for 8 years?
interesting how quickly things can change when there's a high-profile visit.

reddit,2025-08-11 19:08:16,"my take on congress' eci drama. edit note - instead of personal attacks why not discuss what is inaccurate in my post. 

i’ve been a congress supporter since i started voting. i’m 46 now. i've followed and seen congress for quite some time and honestly, rahul gandhi has dragged this party and india’s politics into a joke in the name of “upholding democracy.”

if he truly believes there’s an issue with s.i.r., follow the procedure. file a complaint with the election commission of india (eci). if unsatisfied, move to the supreme court (sc). if you claim to uphold democratic values, then use the democratic process. instead, we get press statements, media soundbites. if he genuinely believed there was something wrong, why didn’t he do the one thing that actually carries legal weight?

why i believe his claims don't hold much water? 

here is the basic procedure i got of the eci website. this applies to booth level agents/ the party workers assigned to each polling station to safeguard voter rolls and detect discrepancies before polling day.

1. party issues appointment letters to blas using form bla-1 and form bla-2, surely signed and which is submitted to the blo of the eci

2. once authorized, the bla (congress worker) receives the draft electoral roll from the blo about 120 days before elections. the bla also receives any supplementary lists that include newly added or deleted names.

3. the blas must go door-to-door to check that every person listed actually lives there and is eligible to vote. identify and mark dead voters, shifted voters, fake/duplicate names, missing eligible voters.

4. cross-check with the final epic number list to spot duplicates.

5. if discrepancies are found, blas must file the following forms through the blo or directly to the electoral registration officer (ero):

form 6 – add eligible voter missing from the list.

form 6a – add overseas voter.

form 7 – object to an ineligible name / request deletion.

form 8 – correction of voter details (name, age, photo, etc.).

these are legal declarations false claims are punishable under section 31 of the representation of the people act, 1950.

6. blas must be present inside or near the polling station to monitor the voter list being used by the presiding officer. they can immediately raise objections if someone tries to vote who isn’t on the final roll or is impersonating another voter.

so what are congress workers doing? how are discrepancies not spotted early? why are they not appointing enough blas for all booths? why are they not doing actual ground verification despite having the list a month in advance? why are they treating blo meetings as formality instead of opportunity to clean rolls.

if the congress does believe there are issues then isn't the current s.i.r being conducted justified? you can't say there are problems and then oppose the procedure to fix the problem.

i just hope saner voices in congress take over and end this circus. he is making this party a laughing stock in the country.

edit correction- electrol rolls are given to parties 120 days before. not 1 month as mentioned earlier"
reddit,2025-08-12 15:41:41,"true dog lovers: please keep them home sustainably, end suffering of strays. dog lovers, hear me out: true love for dogs means giving them safe, healthy homes, not fueling stray overpopulation through indiscriminate feeding. india’s 60 million stray dogs face brutal lives - scavenging garbage, suffering diseases like rabies (causing 18,000-20,000 human deaths yearly, mostly kids and marginalized folks who live on the street sides), and dying young from starvation or accidents. feeding them cheap, protein-less scraps only boosts breeding, leading to more miserable dog lives, aggression, and 37 lakh dog bite cases in 2024 alone, overwhelming cash-strapped governments and terrorizing vulnerable communities. adopt, spay, and care responsibly, please don’t perpetuate the cycle.


the supreme court’s recent order to relocate and sterilize delhi ncr strays has sparked outrage, with many comments veering into whataboutery, deflecting to unrelated issues like human crimes (rape, robbery) to downplay the dog menace. here’s a theory: some of this noise could be amplified by pharmaceutical giants like, who profit from the multi-crore rabies vaccine market tied to persistent stray populations. these firms benefit when rabies cases drive government contracts, and fragmented animal birth control (abc) programs keep the problem alive.


a one-time eradication push - mass euthanasia of dogs, however cruel they might sound (surely less cruel than what happens to innocent humans every years each year) could curb this crisis, reduce rabies, and ease public health costs. effective abc and vaccination programs can stabilize populations from there, but only with proper funding and focus. true dog lovers should adopt from shelters and support policies that prioritize dog welfare, over feeding strays with pseudo kindness."

reddit,2025-08-13 16:47:26,"i support sc's order problem is stray dogs,vaccinated or not, cannot remain on streets regardless. vaccination and sterilization doesn't prevent dog bites. and dogs aren't living any good life on the roads as well. they eat trash, sleep on roads/trash piles/areas where their life might be threatened by other animals. they are also at a risk of being killed/injured by a vehicle.

shelters aren't a practical solution. no city, no government, and no municipality in the whole world can shelter and maintain 1 million dogs.

all the major developed cities have high dog populations, but they are adopted dogs, not stray dogs. a minimal number of dog population lives in shelters which makes running and maintaining shelters practical and manageable for the government. also, a lot of those cities which had high population did initially use euthanasia.

if you care for the dogs, instead of protests start mass adoption drives, adopt as many dogs as you can and can genuinely manage and handle. societies as a whole can adopt as well. keep the dogs with leashes inside the society premises and society members can look after them. mcd won't enter your society to pick up dogs. unless ofc members are careless and allow it to roam on streets without leash.

the problem exists and practically there are only two solutions, first is mass adoption.
the other solution is the cruel, inhumane, and unfortunate solution.

reddit,2025-08-15 11:09:58,"79 years later, is this what independence looks like? it’s been 79 years since independence.

but are we actually independent? we still have corruption from the lowest office to the top. scams happen every year and no one goes to jail. politicians change but the mindset never does. power and money first, people last.

we still can’t provide clean drinking water to every household. electricity cuts are still normal in so many places. education is either too expensive or too useless to get a job. unemployment lmao y’all already know about that, and the jobs that do exist barely pay enough to survive. farmers are still dying because agriculture is treated like a burden instead of the backbone of the country.

women can’t feel safe in public spaces. crimes against them make headlines every single day. caste discrimination is still alive. religious hate is openly fuelled for political gains. lynching, riots, and hate speeches are things we’ve normalised for ages.

healthcare is basically pathetic. people still die because they can’t afford basic treatment or because there aren’t enough doctors, staff, or facilities in rural area. public hospitals are overcrowded and private ones are unaffordable for like 99% indians.

in most areas, the roads are so bad they’re dangerous. public transport is a joke outside a few big cities (still overcrowded there as well). trains are overcrowded, delayed, and unsafe. floods, potholes, and collapsed bridges are still in news like daily.

we’re choking our ”holy“ rivers and forests while pretending to care about the environment. air quality in all major cities is literally poisonous. waste management is almost non-existent in many towns.

and yet, we act like one day of waving flags and posting patriotic captions makes us a great nation. i feel like we’ve been celebrating a lie for 79 years."
reddit,2025-08-15 11:54:34,"79 years of breaking the chains- an analysis of india's independence it has been seventy nine years since india gained independence from foreign rule. for centuries we lived under the control of first islamic invaders and later european colonial powers. we were not only robbed of wealth, but also stripped of our political agency, cultural confidence, and standing in the world. when independence finally arrived in 1947, it came alongside one of the greatest human tragedies in modern history. the partition displaced over fourteen million people and took the lives of as many as two million. families that had lived together for generations were torn apart. imagine living in the only home you have ever known, enduring generations of subjugation, and just as the oppressors leave, your own brothers and sisters are told to go forever. that was the reality for millions.

yet from that devastation, the country began to rise. our leaders planted the seed of democracy, giving us a constitution in 1950 that granted every adult the right to vote. at that time, this was something few democracies in the world had achieved so early. suddenly, those in power were coming to the people’s doorsteps asking for votes. institutions like the iits and iims opened their doors to all. untouchability was abolished, and people once considered outside the social order could now compete on the basis of merit. it was a time of transformation and optimism. we rebuilt our economy and our self-confidence. the green revolution in the 1960s ensured that the country could feed itself. in 1991, economic reforms opened new opportunities. scientists such as vikram sarabhai and homi bhabha made us a spacefaring nation. we reached the moon and mars. in education, technology, and social policy, we achieved progress that earlier generations could not have imagined.

but alongside these achievements, a more difficult question remains. are we truly free? political independence removed the foreign ruler, but does every citizen today enjoy the freedom to live with dignity, without fear, and without barriers? some chains remain, created not by outsiders but by our own systems and society.

one area that demands attention is the state of our constitutional bodies. these were created to stand above politics, to act as the guardians of the constitution, and to protect the rights of citizens. at times in our history, they have lived up to that duty. the election commission, for example, under t. n. seshan in the 1990s, became a symbol of fearlessness, enforcing the model code of conduct strictly and showing that no political party was beyond scrutiny. and the same election body is losing its credibility faster than the politicians it conducts. 

the media, once celebrated as the fourth pillar of democracy, is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few corporate houses, making it harder for diverse voices to be heard. i have personally experienced how fragile these freedoms can be. i once spoke at a cultural programme on independence day in a news studio. moments after mentioning a peaceful protest happening nearby, the recording was stopped. i was told to avoid talking about the problems of the country. this was not even a state-owned channel. it became clear to me in that moment how easily the right to speak can be curtailed, not just by the state, but by institutions that fear its displeasure.

i think of a dalit friend who works in top management at microsoft. his colleagues, unaware of his caste, spoke in degrading terms about dalits right in front of him. he chose to remain silent, fearing that speaking out could harm his career. can we truly say he is free? the lgbtq community still does not have the legal right to marry. people are judged for whom they love, and denied the same rights as others. economic inequality also challenges our idea of freedom. youth unemployment remains high despite growth. workers in the gig economy often lack basic protections. environmental degradation is displacing indigenous communities and making air and water unsafe for millions. digital freedoms face threats from surveillance and frequent internet shutdowns. gender-based violence continues to be widespread, with justice often delayed.

freedom from colonial rule was only the first step. true liberation means freedom from poverty, prejudice, fear, and systemic injustice. it means living in a society where constitutional values are not just ideals on paper but a reality experienced by every citizen. the question is no longer whether we achieved independence. the question is whether we have been able to protect and expand it.

reddit,2025-08-15 12:10:36,"stop jugaad this independence day. india has always been known for jugaad or the uniquely indian philosophy of resourceful problem-solving and frugal innovation. it embodies the art of finding creative, low-cost solutions using whatever materials and resources are available, often in unconventional ways, just to get the job done.

however there is another angle to this *philosophy* \- that is to somehow get the job done one way or the other if the designated way to do it is costly in terms of time or effort or plain cost.

basically in other words, challenging the authority and breaking it just to get the job done.

examples of jugaad that don't generally come to mind:

1. not following the rules on the road - for example, riding the two-wheeler on the footpath meant for pedestrians - why ? because the roads are jammed, and why wait like everyone else ? ride on the footpath, ride on the opposite side of the road - because - the work has to be accomplished one way or the other. the fact that our road infrastructure is so poor and has not been able to keep up with the population explosion is unfortunately not a reason to break rules and somehow keep the show going on.
2. using sub-standard materials to get the job done - roads or bridges for example are classic examples of contractors using sub-standard materials or not confirming to construction standards in order to somehow get the job done in the available budget. this affects us in so many ways - people lose their lives but due to jugaad we have somehow made it happen using low-cost solutions. again i would agree that we don't have enough budgets, but instead of many substandard roads, can we not have a few standard roads and stop the jugaad ?
3. bribery - classic jugaad to jump queues and to get the job done - ""kuch jugaad ho sakta hai kya ?"" is an open invitation to bribery - whether it is getting your license done or getting away with traffic violation or pushing your files ahead - it is just unfortunate. why not just accept your mistake and pay the fine ? why not just wait for the right way to get things done ? i agree that if the government officials themselves ask for this, there is no other way for the common man to not bribe. it just reflects a very sad state of affairs. why doesn't the government upgrade its facilities to manage the scale problem ?
4. garbage disposal - indians are known to litter things around - because it is again too costly / not worth their time to find a dustbin - so just dump it in someplace where nobody is watching - perhaps on a corner or behind the tree or even dump it in a lake - anything but carry one's own garbage and dispose it correctly - the job must get done - jugaad / low-cost solution. why even segregate dry / wet / metal / bio-waste ? just dump it and someone will do it - easy ! this even extends to public urination - why bother to even find a public toilet ? low cost way to just urinate where nobody is watching.
5. adulteration in food - why bother building the right supply chain and logistics if one could inject chemicals into unripe fruits / vegetables or even go to the extent of artificially coloring them or mixing other adulterants in them - just to get the job done - easy low cost solution.

i can go on and on - but this is the attitude that is eroding us as a people. we need to stop this jugaad and demand the right way to do things, not take shortcuts, learn from the people who do it well and do the right jugaads - i.e. genuine optimisations without a loss in quality."

i’ve been noticing a recurring foul smell, similar to the stench you get when a bbmp garbage truck passes by (kind of like rotting jackfruit) almost every night in parts of west and south bengaluru (nagarabhavi, ngef layout, banashankari). strangely, i caught the same smell near peenya the other day as well.

i’m puzzled, could this be from people burning garbage, a particular tree releasing a strong odour, or perhaps industrial emissions?

our air purifier at home goes absolutely berserk the moment the smell starts, showing red on the indicator. it’s worrying to think about what we might be breathing in and how it could affect our health.

my father owns a workshop for his business. basically there is a female stray dog in the street where the workshop is located. this stray used to sleep in the entrance of the workshop at night. we didn’t mind, in fact we built a small shed for her to sleep during the night times. my father brings her food from home whenever we cook meat and this goes on for a few months. a few months later she was pregnant. during her pregnancy we made food for her every day with meat my father used to feed her. we also let her sleep inside the shop during her pregnancy at night. a few days later the puppies were born. the puppies were initially somewhere near the dumpster where there was so much garbage. my father brought those puppies and kept them well protected inside his shop and the mother was ok with it. she used to come and check on her puppies. the fact that she trusted my father with her puppies was so wholesome. we kept the puppies and the mother fed them. a few days later when the pups started walking and discovering the world they were unstoppable!! they would roam behind their mother wagging their tails!! but unfortunately one pup died while a four wheeler crashed as the pup was crossing the road. the mother dog seemed very down. we were alerted and tried our best to keep the other two inside but no luck. a few days later two huge dogs bit the pups and they were severely injured, we took them to the vet and got some sprays the vet prescribed. sadly, the two pups were gone the next day when my father opened his shop. we were heartbroken but the mother was found nowhere. the mother dog came around the next day and she started whimpering and crying to my dad like keeping her front two legs on his legs and was crying. it was heartbreaking. fast forward she stopped eating and she was just different. she occasionally came to my dad to cry and let her heart out. fast forward one year later she was pregnant again. this time she was very cautious. my father started to feed her again and this time she was eating well. suddenly the dog was missing for two days or so. after two days she came and was waiting for my dad to come and open his shop. the moment he opened his door the mother dog pulled his pants with her mouth and started taking him somewhere. she took him to the place where she kept her puppies. the moment melted my father and my family. this time it was a litter of 5 puppies. my father took two first then brought them to his shop and the mother carried one in her mouth to his shop and went again to bring the other two pups. this time we keep the doors locked to be extra careful. my father still feeds the puppies and the mother dog. the puppies are around 1.5 months now.

just felt like sharing such a wholesome moment. this proves how lovely strays can be but we just have to win over their trust and prove to them. people don’t understand this and try to vanish them forever. if you throw stones at them they will come back at you for their own protection. instead of throwing stones and hate try showering them with love once then you will understand how loyal they are.

i always took it lightly and never replied back… until yesterday.

i caught a high fever (for context: i got drenched while trying to help a boy whose scooty got stuck in a pothole). when i mentioned this to her, she once again said, “that’s because you eat chicken.” this time it really triggered me and we ended up in an argument.

first it was vegetarian vs non-vegetarian. i brought up the life of cows in indian dairies, to which she replied that she feeds two chapatis to a cow every day and doesn’t care about the rest. basically being deliberately naive or just ignorant.

then, very “smartly,” she shifted the topic to religion—which i didn’t want to argue about because it’s a sensitive topic and i personally follow a humanist ideology. but in the flow, i did slightly challenge the andhbhakti and religious extremism going around.

that was it. she jumped straight to declaring me “anti-national,” and then, out of nowhere, labeled me “pro-palestine islamist.” mind you, i’ve never said a single word on palestine or religion in that way. it was all her own assumption.

the audacity and shamelesness with which the eleciton commission has conducted the press conference on a sunday( govt holiday) - the same day as rahul gandhi's first day of the march in bihar, shows one thing - the election commission is not backing down. they know that they will get jailed if bjp goes out of power. hence they will continue their frauds - voter listes, evm's, disqualifications of oppositon leaders in elections, to do the bidding of the bj pary save their own asses. 

this makes people's protests and opposition as the only reliable means to mount pressure on these corrupt institutions, take the power back, and restore sanctity to constitutional bodies. without that, the rights and freedoms of people will go down, while we get taxed tf out of everything for traffic, pothole filled roads, pollution, and unemployment. 

was annoyed to the brim listening to his answers in the press conference. even thought some journalists have asked good questions, i wish some of them countered him saying that his responses dont answer the question, and he is just giving excuses for the lapse in ec's duty to conduct free and fair elections."

reddit,2025-08-18 13:08:37,"my old activa’s is thirstier than i am in summer — anyone else faced this issue? so i ride a 2013 honda activa that’s been my trusty sidekick for over a decade. it’s carried me through college, late-night chai runs, rainy monsoon roads, and even the occasional “let’s see how many people we can fit on this seat” experiment.

but lately… it’s acting like it’s developed a drinking problem. i’m getting barely 30 km per litre, which feels insane for a scooter that used to be super reliable. what’s confusing is that there’s no fuel leakage when it’s parked — the tank isn’t mysteriously draining. it’s only when i’m riding that the petrol just disappears.

i even took it to the authorised service center, they have changed the air filter in normal servicing and they’ve already checked for leaks and gone as far as to change the carburettor— but the issue is still there.

now i’m stuck wondering: is this some deeper carburetor tuning drama, clogged air filter, spark plug mischief, or something else entirely? before i hand it over again and risk them blindly swapping parts, i’d love to know if anyone else has been through this exact phase with their activa (or any old scooter).

what did you try? what actually worked? would love to hear your stories (and maybe save my poor wallet from more petrol money 😅).

at this point, it honestly feels like i’m fueling a royal enfield bullet disguised as an activa🛵➡️🏍️💸.


**update**
recently i tried filling shell v-power petrol for ₹100, and i noticed something interesting — the fuel gauge actually showed a higher increment compared to when i had filled the same ₹100 worth of normal shell fuel. this makes me wonder if the quality/calibration of the regular fuel might be contributing to my activa’s abnormal mileage issue."
reddit,2025-08-19 22:07:47,"i fully support sc decision on stray dogs! i want to start by saying i’m an avid dog lover, though i haven’t adopted one since i’ve mostly lived in hostels.

i commute about 50 km daily (25 up and 25 down), mostly on a national highway with decent conditions. i leave early in the morning with minimal traffic and return at night when there’s no sunlight. the problem: almost every day i come across stray dogs, sometimes in groups of 20 spread across small towns. in the mornings i manage by being careful, but at night, with poor lighting and blinding high beams from oncoming traffic, it’s nearly impossible.

i see at least two dead strays on the road daily, with others mourning beside them, it’s heartbreaking. today i almost hit one myself, and that was the last straw. i realized strays simply cannot survive on highways.

yes, government policies on this may not be perfect and could mean euthanising dogs, but honestly, that’s still better than them getting crushed on roads. this is aside from the risks of rabies and attacks on humans.

what’s the solution? obviously not asking activists to adopt thousands of dogs. but maybe activist groups and the government can find common ground, activists could oversee or participate in the process instead of just protesting. protests against the judgment feel like a waste of time, working together for a realistic solution would help both humans and dogs. what do you guys think?"

suggestion- e rickshaw can solve the problem to a large extent, although with some caveats obviously. but this solution has worked all across india, especially delhi where all public trnasport is connected to last mile through e-rickshaws thus leading to lesser personal vehicles on road.

caveat- e rickshaws are infamous for random turns, unsafe driving habits, but that's already quite a norm after the rise of food delivery and quick commerce.

reddit,2025-08-20 21:36:44,"i come from a vegetarian family. vegetarianism is nothing but a tool to segregate society. i come from an upper-caste hindu north indian family. no one in my extended family consumes meat products. the aversion to meat is so strong in my parents that they would ask me to switch the channel if they came across a show that involved cooking food with meat in it. they also avoid going to restaurants that have non-vegetarian items on their menu. to indians from other regions, this might seem too extreme, but among our relatives, community, social network and workplace, such an attitude is considered perfectly normal. my grandfather used to say something along the lines of - *consumption of meat makes demons rejoice*. you might think this has to do with a strong sense of morality, i believed so as well. but it's their attitude towards people who do consume meat that makes it clear that vegetarianism has nothing to do with ethics or love for animals.

vegetarians will consume dairy with abandon, they have to, in order to make up for the lack of protein in their diet. but no one wonders what becomes of dairy animals. a cow is, after all, raped repeatedly through artificial insemination and made to produce milk all its life. when it finally stops gestating, it's sent to a slaughterhouse to be turned into leather or let loose on the road to feed on trash and die as roadkill. no matter how much upper caste hindus claim to love cows, they'll not approach the corpse of one. even a cow owner won't deal with the corpse because it's considered the exclusive domain of lower caste hindus. vegetarians (since they are predominantly upper caste hindus) are perfectly willing to support a political party whose explicit agenda is to target and persecute minorities, whose leader is popular precisely because of the slaughter of indians he oversaw. somehow not consuming chicken or goats is considered a loftier ideal than empathy for fellow human beings. how can anyone be okay with lynching humans to save animals?

it's because vegetarianism has nothing to do with morality, but with *purity*. you have my guarantee that when lab produced meat is introduced on a large scale, vegetarians will still choose to avoid even though there is no cruelty involved. there's also something called pure vegetarianism which excludes eggs. an egg is nothing more than the period of a hen that is unfertilized. it will never result in a chick hatching from it, but it is excluded from a pure vegetarian diet because it is considered impure. this is why an indian vegetarian is perfectly fine consuming animal products like milk, butter and ghee, or wearing silk saris that involve boiling silkworms alive. since these products are considered to be pure, it does not reflect badly on you to consume them. by extension, those who consume meat are considered impure, dirty, and unclean. these people are unworthy of consideration or respect, and more importantly association in society. vegetarianism signals to others in society that you belong to the same social strata as them. a meat eater on the other hand is to be avoided, pushed as much as possible to the margins to live in slums and ghettos.

think about it. my family, and vegetarians like them, claim to be disgusted by meat. how is it in any way normal to find what 70% of indians, and the vast majority of humanity, consume to be revolting? their problem is not with the food, it's with the people, because they associate meat with being lower caste. it's the horror of doing something that will degrade their status that makes them avoid meat at all costs. this is why there is segregated seating in cafeterias in universities, government offices and in private companies, it's so that vegetarians don't get inconvenienced by the presence of meat eaters around them.  you know where else similar segregation happens? in government schools in the hinterlands, where dalit or tribal children are made to sit at the back, or when a mid-day meal cook gets kicked out because upper caste students won't consume food made by her. why do people rent apartments only to people who are vegetarian like themselves? it's because our homes, our food and our weddings are the key markers of our status. the intrusion of lower castes in any of these three spaces either by renting our houses, eating food with us or marrying us will lead to a loss in societal status.

why does a illogical term like **non-vegetarian** exist solely in india? a so-called non-vegetarian does consume vegetables and fruits, and a vegetarian consumes animal products like dairy. yet, 30% of the indian population has managed to define the normal diet of people throughout the world as the outlier. 90% of humans on this planet are defined by the fact that they are *not vegetarians.*"

by saturday morning, there was a good amount of dry waste piled up. so i packed everything neatly into a black bag and left it just outside my house before leaving ,the bbmp guy usually comes around 9 am and picks it up if it’s kept properly there. thought i was doing the sensible thing and left for my trip.

cut to today morning, 7 am ,cops(most probably bbmp marshals as mentioned by someone in comments) show up at my place while i’m still sleeping. they told my roommate that we had dumped waste on the road and we have to pay ₹1000 fine. the funniest part, they even mentioned my girlfriend’s name and said she should pay.

turns out, inside that bag was an old parcel cover with her name and my address. that’s how they traced it back to us. my roommate, still half-asleep, just paid the fine on the spot and then woke me up to narrate the story. what a crazy way to start the day. also will try to be more responsible from now on.

the bridgestone world solar challenge 2025 is around the corner — a global event that pushes the limits of solar-powered mobility and showcases cutting-edge student innovation in sustainable transport. yet again, **not a single indian team is participating**. what's more disheartening is that **no major indian company — not tata, mahindra, adani, waaree, or even tata power solar — has stepped up to support or sponsor a solar car project** from india.

this is especially surprising given india’s ambitions in the clean energy and ev space. companies like tata and mahindra are pushing evs, while adani and waaree dominate parts of the solar sector. but when it comes to supporting grassroots innovation and global competitions that could boost india's presence on the world stage — it's complete silence.

even smaller nations are fielding university teams backed by government grants and corporate sponsorship. indian students and engineering colleges are not short of talent — but without institutional support, how can we expect them to compete globally?

are these companies missing a golden opportunity to invest in the future of clean transportation and innovation? or is this just another case of corporate and institutional apathy toward r&amp;d-heavy, long-term projects?

would love to hear thoughts from the community especially if anyone knows of underground indian efforts in solar mobility or has ideas on how to get india represented in 2027.

now, before i tell you what happened next, let me make one thing clear. i know this is not easy. i know i’ll have to deal with babus, garbage mafias, endless red tape, and people who don’t care. i know most indians lack civic sense. i know it’s a long road.

but despite all of that, i will keep working. i will keep trying. because i have also discovered something powerful: there are still good people out there. people who are not corrupt. people who are ready to help. people who are angry about the state of their cities and want change.

so, i started small. small enough that i wouldn’t be crushed by the system, but big enough to matter.

and here’s what happened in just one week.

in darbhanga, bihar, my hometown, i used my personal savings and persuaded ward councillors to cooperate. we cleaned filthy roadsides. the ward has already begun laying a proper road with materials in place. i hired poor locals on daily wages, and they were grateful for the income. people are now guarding the cleaned spots and they’ve stayed clean. local media covered it. my mom, my relatives, my friends—people i never thought would care—are now pitching in. donations have started.

all this in one single week.

the lesson? we, the people, are far more powerful than we think. we just haven’t realized it yet.

this is only the beginning. if you want to contribute—whether it’s in kind (jcbs, supplier connections, materials, contacts), money, or simply by sharing this post—do it. it matters.

i’m also setting up a small whatsapp group. not just to talk, but to act. i’ll be there every single day. if you want to join, let me know in the comments.

1. improper or broken footpaths with no consistencies 

2. 2 wheelers using it as an alternate road

3. obstructions on the existing footpath with either construction material or large banners 

4. shops expanding till wherever they want also hogging parking space and walking space.

i have tried complaining through bbmp sahaya but they closed without working ( as expected).i tried twitter too and that didn't work too. i don't know how to entirely solve this but i have a solution which is temporary but could become permanent if executed in all parts of the city.

a lot of cities have iron railings on footpaths so that their is a clear demarcation between road and footpath, this causes the two wheelers to not ride on the footpath. as a temporary replacement can we come up with something like bamboo fences, like the one you put creeper plants on?? 

it is not very costly and can be done in every ward through crowd funding. obviously i am aware that someone might remove it or shift it but i think its worth a try.

also, in what other ways can we deal with the above issues so that bbmp sees it ?

multiple emails to the bbmp chief commissioner, zonal and joint commissioners and calls to the bbmp helpline, zonal control room and calls/texts to the medical officer, health officer and email to the cho have not helped with the chronic noise and nuisance from multiple automotive establishments in our immediate neighborhood. we have had to resort to calling the police numerous times for more than one commercial establishment. because this is a chronic issue and it doesn't truly come under the police authority, they are only able to talk to these people and the noise reduces for at most half a day, and then, things go back to the way they were. we are not sure if the pollution board can help because they apparently only consider constant and high decibel noise as problematic and refer back to the bbmp.

has anyone been able to get the bbmp to act effectively to get such issues resolved permanently (without losing unacceptable amounts of time, effort, quality of life and sanity)? 

we spent over 6 months in this year to get a neighboring commercial establishment vacated and it is not an experience we would wish on anyone. we already have intolerable noise for more than 3/4 of every day from residential sources (yes, they are unreasonable) and we have spent years negotiating with the problematic ones (there is but one). we also have been contending with traffic noise from nearly 5 am to 1 am, not that we are aware of twilight hours every time. 

it is these automotive establishments that have been mushrooming out of proportion in terms of number and noise and monopoly over the soundscape that we need help with. it is the bbmp that issues and is responsible for withdrawing trade licenses. we would be grateful for any advice or help.

the plan is to work in collaboration with bbmp and the government to transform our city’s flyovers, walls, footpaths, and other neglected public spaces into vertical and horizontal gardens\*\*.\*\* imagine walking under a flyover covered in greenery instead of bare concrete, or seeing living walls instead of dull grey stretches.

this won’t just make the city beautiful, but also help:

* reduce dust &amp; pollution
* lower heat &amp; improve micro-climate
* provide green walkways for the community
* restore a sense of pride in our city

reddit,2025-08-27 21:55:22,"pet euthanizing/funeral - everything you need to know i would like to share the events that happened today upon my pet's death, covering quite a lot of difficult topics. could be a rant or awareness for pet parents in bengaluru. 

my furry friend, labrador, 12 years old, has been suffering from chronic kidney condition and difficulty to breathe due to trachea related issues due to age. he lived a very disciplined life, a true family member who wouldn't, would never, do his business inside the house, would wait for me to get back home or finish my work, to go out, never would create problems in the apartment, always friendly, to everyone around, always happy and wagging. 

since the past few weeks he has struggled to do his basic needs, wouldn't want to go out, stopped drinking water since the last three weeks, no usual food intake. now comes the difficult decision and i had no clue how i gained courage to accept it. i had to talk about the difficult topic of euthanizing him to my family. we decided to wait but he could not walk, his legs would bent down in pain and i managed to take the decision and made my family agree to it. he cannot live that life after living so well, he needs a good send off, it's not about taking care of him for the rest of his life, but it was about the quality of life he lived and the struggle he went through in the past few weeks, not responding to any medical help. 

jeeva hospital, both jp nagar and kanakpura branch , were his clinics for consultation and vaccination and also the place for his critical care in the past few weeks. 

we used their ambulance service from my home to the clinic first, the doctor helped complete the procedure and my friend was put to sleep immediately, totally painless, and thats probably the best decision we could take for him. for pet parents struggling to decide when there is no way of improvement, i reassure you that its never easy to decide, but your furry friend does not understand death, end of life or anything related and you have to let go to make sure they have a good end to their life. 

now comes the part of funeral. the bbmp crematorium in sumanahalli has been out of order for the past few months. the only easy way to electrically cremate pets in the city run by the government isn't functional and nobody really cares about it. at a cost standpoint, that's the easiest any pet parent could afford, if they don't own their land in the city or would like to cremate their furry friend. now that isn't working so we have to make last minute calls and enquire about funerals. comes the package options from different vendors, 9k, 16k, 30k and so on. and that's when i wondered, how could someone who has a pet and has to bury them, give them a good send off, be able to afford this? 

the only option we had was to take him to pfa wildlife rescue and conservation centre in sunkalpalya. very respectfully completed all the rites. easy process. excellent management. 
they have packages for burial that starts at rs. 5,500  for an year of hold, 20k for 3 years, 30k for 5 years. you have the option to extend later too. i had selected the 1 year plan and later enquired about having a tombstone with engraving or pictures that could be done and included in the 3/5 year package. we could revisit and decide to extend the plan anytime within this period too. you also get a receipt and the money goes into donation of the conservation centre, can be claimed for tax returns too.

im not guilty, he lived a good life and we were able to give him a good send off too. but what concerns me is for someone who cannot afford, it's a challenge not to have and be confused about a burial place. 

with my previous furry friend's death, around 7 years ago, we had used the service of the bbmp crematorium and it was very affordable. we also retained her ashes in an urn, preserved till date and we used that today during his funeral. we plan to invest on an engraved tombstone and an extended plan at the pfa centre for the both of them. 

i wanted to sound as practical and easy as possible in this post possibly to help someone who is going through a similar situation. as i said, it's never easy, but it's the best we could do for them. there is a huge gap in my routine, a gap in our lives that will stay. but he lived a good life according to us. and i'm sure he was happy with us. always playful and a joy to be with. 

advice for the ones who read through the post so far,
watch your pets diet seriously, manage weight, do not decide to ""buy"" pets if you cannot manage, maybe adopt or donate to animal welfare. medications are expensive, treatments are expensive. if you can, we have insurance options for pets in india now, make use of it. i have an overall experience of handling and living with dogs for 15 years, please feel free to ask me anything. i hope you have a great time with your furry friends and decide what's only best for them. 

tldr: lab/12 yo, suffered chronic kidney issues, got euthanized, struggled a bit to find out burial space, bbmp crematorium temporarily closed, managed it all well at the end.

costs
ultrasound scans, xrays, medicines: 12000-15000
ambulance from jeeva hospital - pick up and drop - 2000 (depends on distance too)
euthanize charges: 2000

reddit,2025-08-28 20:33:14,"city day hello all,

i have been living in this city for the past five years, and during this time i have had the opportunity to meet amazing people. this city has given me the chance to grow both personally and professionally.

i know this city has a unique combination of good and bad aspects. it has so many wonderful things and people, but today i want to talk about a problem that we, the residents, must address together.

the problem is cleanliness and civic responsibility.
(i know there are many more severe issues, but i am raising this because i truly believe i can contribute to improving it.)

having visited many areas in bangalore and karnataka, one common issue i’ve noticed is unwalkable footpaths and litter everywhere. i have also observed that while the bbmp is making efforts, the city is still not as clean as it should be. one clear pattern is that wherever there is already a garbage patch, people tend to throw even more garbage there.

i often see people litter near open and unbarricaded sewers, vacant land, dustbins, and along footpaths.

we cannot always blame the government for every problem. as citizens of this city, we can solve this issue very easily by taking civic responsibility.

another major challenge in bangalore is traffic. while better infrastructure and public transport are long-term solutions, a significant factor contributing to this problem is people not following lane discipline. many rush, overtake recklessly, and drive without caution—leading to frequent accidents in the city.

⸻

here are some solutions and suggestions:
	1.	be a responsible citizen – always throw waste in designated places. if you see someone littering, try to confront them politely or report it.
	2.	follow road lane discipline – be careful, drive responsibly, and avoid causing inconvenience or danger to others.

reddit,2025-08-30 15:16:55,"what if we could simulate running the government and actually learn how hard it is? i’ve been thinking a lot about how in india (and really everywhere), people criticize the government no matter which party is in power. we talk about poverty, joblessness, corruption, poor education and blame the current leaders. but when power shifts, the complaints stay the same. 

what if we built a simulation where any citizen can step into the shoes of the government?

the goal isn’t a game for fun it’s more like an interactive simulator where you manage the budget, pass policies, tweak tax rates and deal with real-world events like protests, inflation, or unemployment.

features we can add:

* allocate real budget in sectors like education, defense, health.
* pass policies like free healthcare, farm loan waivers, tax cuts etc.
* use real data for gdp, inr value, unemployment rate etc.
* try to balance development, public satisfaction, and re-election.

the idea is to help people understand the complexity of governance and maybe even shift how we engage with politics. would love feedback on whether something like this could be useful for people."

what i don’t understand is why mysore’s roads are so good most of the time. they are wide, there’s not much of a garbage issue even during and after the rains, and there aren’t many speedbreakers.

and just 140 odd kilometers across, it’s totally the opposite here in our bangalore city.

it’s the same government that runs both cities, right? if there’s a will and a way to keep that city lean and the way it should be, why not apply that will to bangalore as well? what fails for banglaore ?

hey folks, 

i’m beyond frustrated and need to vent about the absolute mess caused by a roadwork project in j p nagar 5th phase that started in may 2025. a contractor g. b. naidu was supposed to install sanitary pipelines, but instead, they’ve left our neighborhood in shambles. here’s what’s going down:

•  destroyed roads &amp; footpaths: they dug up half the road and the entire footpath, leaving them unusable. instead of fixing it, they dumped gravel (jalli kallu) and ghosted. the road is now a pothole minefield, damaging vehicles daily. rains turn it into a muddy, slippery mess, splashing dirt onto pedestrians, homes, and shops.

•  electricity chaos: while digging, they wrecked our homes’ electricity connections. we’re stuck with unsafe temporary wiring, and i had to shell out ₹3,000 for a temp fix. no sign of permanent restoration yet!

•  extortion tactics: the contractor’s team had the audacity to demand ₹2,000–₹3,000 per household to install the pipelines, threatening to skip homes that didn’t pay. straight-up extortion, when we’re already paying taxes for this!

•  safety nightmare: the broken road and missing footpath are a hazard, especially for kids and the elderly. vehicles are getting wrecked, and pedestrians risk accidents daily. rain makes it worse, spreading slush and ruining hygiene.

as taxpayers, we expect basic infrastructure, not this circus of negligence and harassment. this has caused financial strain, daily frustration, and unsafe conditions for everyone.

we need:
•  proper road and footpath restoration asap.
•  fixed electricity connections.
•  action against the contractor for negligence and extortion.

anyone else dealing with similar contractor nonsense in bangalore? how do we escalate this to bbmp or get media attention? any tips on organizing residents to demand accountability? let’s get this sorted!"

but execution requires dedication and control over one thing.

solution : stop or reduce the consumption of sugarcane and corn based products. reduce your intake of sugar and sweets and in a couple of year they will have to stop ethanol production because of no demand of main product ie sugarcane and corn.  
this will solve four problems,

1. less stubble burning pollution, which is actually the main reason behind bringing e20 at the first place.
2. water shortage issue, it takes 200+ litter of water to make just 1 kg of sugarcane.
3. right now gov is promoting production of sugarcane because they want more ethanol, and for this they are sending a lot of money, which can be saved.
4. it will solve e20 imposition as well, or at least they will be forced reduce the target from e20 to e10.

cut to today morning around 5am, i’m walking back home from the bus stop. out of nowhere, a couple on a scooter pulls over right in front of me. and what do they do? casually toss two big bags of garbage onto the pile, like it’s their personal dustbin.

i couldn’t hold it in. in kannada, i asked, “why are you throwing here?” they just ignored me and tried to flee. that ticked me off. i switched to english “do you even have common sense? why the hell are you throwing here?”

bro didn’t even flinch. he said, “apna kaam karna.” that was it. my patience broke. i switched to hindi, before i knew it, “chutiya ho kya?” slipped out. (yeah, i was furious, didn’t mean to be rude, but it just came out).

things escalated fast. the lady shot back, “so many people throw here. go tell all of them first before telling us.”

at this point, i calmly pulled out my phone, turned on the flash, and started recording them and their scooter. told them i’ll be filing a complaint. i called them senseless, no civic sense, all of it, because honestly, it’s true.

then the lady started recording me! she yelled, “jo karna hai kar. i’ll also complain of harassment against you in the police station.” and with that, they fled the scene. i know what a false harassment complaint can do to me, i deleted the video, came home and slept. 

some people wake up early to jog, some to pray and some to dump trash? 😭

reddit,2025-09-03 00:10:35,"smart cities? more like water parks funded by our taxes every damn year the same story. heavy rains in gurgaon, bangalore, mumbai, delhi ncr — and suddenly these “world-class cities” look like someone forgot to close the bathroom tap. roads turn into swimming pools, flyovers turn into waterfalls, and we taxpayers are left playing “urban flood simulator 2025” for free.

and let’s be clear — the people living in these cities are not freeloaders. they are the ones paying the highest direct taxes in the country. salaries taxed before they even see the money. on top of that, every single chai, every uber, every netflix subscription — indirect taxes galore. gst ka bhi gst dete hai hum.

but what do we get back? potholes disguised as roads. “smart city” promises that collapse the moment the sky sneezes. metro stations that flood like they’re auditioning for aquaman. and municipal “disaster management” that’s basically one guy with a bucket and a whatsapp group.

it’s not just about inconvenience — it’s the insult. people grinding 12-hour days, working in it, finance, startups, bpos — literally fueling india’s economy — and their reward is a free water park in front of their office gate. try explaining to your us client on zoom why you missed the call: “sorry sir, my car turned into a boat.”

and then every year the same circus: politicians show up with rolled-up trousers for photo-ops, hashtags trend, memes fly, and within a week everyone forgets. till the next rain comes. rinse and repeat.

at this point, the taxpayers of india’s big cities don’t need “smart cities.” they need basic dignity. a city that doesn’t crumble every monsoon. a road that doesn’t eat your car. a drainage system that isn’t 50% jugaad and 50% prayer.

reddit,2025-09-03 21:18:58,"last night i survived a brutal scooty crash in heavy rain , my helmet saved my life, strangers didn’t. hii everyone , i am 20m,                                                                                                                              last night around 8 pm, i took my scooty to pick up my father from the bus station. the rain was pouring heavily, and i wore my raincoat and helmet before stepping out.

after riding for about four minutes, i witnessed something that shook me. a girl riding her scooty in front of me suddenly skidded on the wet road and fell hard. without a second thought, i parked my scooty and ran towards her. she was in pain, with scratches on her left hand and cuts on her feet. so i helped her up, took her to a nearby clinic, and stayed with her until the doctor dressed her wounds and gave her a tetanus injection.

while all this was happening, my father, waiting at the bus station, kept calling me. so, i gave her my number, took hers, and even called her brother to inform him about her condition and location so they could come pick her up. before leaving, i told her, “please call me once you reach home safely, so that i don’t stay anxious.” only then did i step out of the clinic and get back on my scooty.

i thought the worst part of the night was over, but life had something else planned for me.

as i rode towards the bus station, i entered a stretch of road that was pitch dark. the streetlights were not working, and the entire road was flooded with rainwater. i slowed down to about 30 km/h, trying to be careful. suddenly, hidden beneath the water, there was a speed breaker and right after it, a deep pothole. i couldn’t see either. the moment my scooty went over them, i completely lost balance, and within seconds, i crashed violently.

i don’t remember much for the next minute. everything went black. when i slowly regained consciousness, i realized i was lying on the road, bleeding. blood was flowing from my nose, my back was burning with scratches, and my arms and legs were badly injured. my shoulder and tailbone hurt so much that even breathing felt painful.

at that moment, i saw two bikers who had been riding ahead of me. they had stopped after hearing the loud crash. for a second, i felt relieved, thinking they would come to help me. but to my utter shock and heartbreak, they simply looked at me saw me lying there, bleeding and then moved on. that moment broke me from the inside. it wasn’t the physical pain that made me cry, it was the realization that humanity is fading. how could someone see a fellow human in that condition and still not help?

i lay there on the road for few minutes, hoping someone would stop. no one did. finally, i told myself, *if i don’t get up, no one will.* with every ounce of energy left in me, i forced myself to stand up. my whole body was trembling. i somehow lifted my scooty, which was badly damaged, and started walking towards the bus station, which was still about 2 km away. my phone was broken in the crash, so i couldn’t even call my father.

when i finally reached the bus station, i saw my father waiting for me. the moment he saw me covered in blood, barely able to walk he rushed to me and hugged me tightly. without wasting a second, he took me to the nearest hospital. i was admitted for the entire night, treated for my injuries, and discharged only this morning.

lying in that hospital bed, i thought deeply about everything that happened. this incident has left me with lessons i will carry for life, and i want to share them with everyone.

the first and most important **my helmet saved my life.** if not for the helmet, i might not be here writing this today. my head was completely safe. the only injury i got on my nose was because i was wearing an open-face helmet and hadn’t closed it properly. that one mistake caused the injury. please, never ride without a helmet, and if possible, wear a full face one. your life is far too precious to risk.

second, i realized how dangerous our roads really are. a hidden speed breaker and a pothole submerged in water caused such a severe crash, even though i was riding slowly. the poor condition of roads and unnecessary speed breakers put countless lives at risk every single day. and yet, nothing changes.

and finally, the part that hurt me the most **the lack of empathy.** those bikers who saw me bleeding and still chose not to help that memory will stay with me forever. it wasn’t strangers ignoring me, it felt like humanity itself had turned its face away. we often complain that people in india lack civic sense, but now i feel we are also losing basic compassion.

if you have read this far, i just want to leave you with two requests. please, always wear a helmet when you ride. no matter how short the distance, no matter how confident you feel, it can save your life. and second, please, please don’t turn away when you see someone in trouble. stop. help. show kindness. you never know, you might save a life.

last night changed me. it showed me how fragile life is, how cruel reality can be, but also how important it is to be strong and to care for others. i hope my words makes at least one person more careful, more compassionate, and more human."

so here’s where i want to start a conversation: is there really nothing we as bangaloreans can do about this? every day it’s just “accept traffic, complain, repeat.” but why can’t we collectively push for solutions — better public transport, staggered work hours, smarter traffic management, or something that actually changes things?

we're planning to arrive and stay in mumbai for around 5 days. 

after that, we’ll take a flight to goa for another four days (south goa, to be precise).

then we’ll take a train to kochi (with a half-day stopover in udupi, most likely in 2ac), where we plan to rent a car and self-drive around kerala for another 5 - 6 days, mainly exploring alappuzha (kerala backwaters), periyar and the munnar area. 



my main questions are:

\- how do you manage mumbai as an introvert and socially reserved/anxious woman the best? (that pretty much describes her, but don’t get me wrong - she’s still interested in visiting india, lol)

\- what's the best way to avoid the taxi mafia in goa? if that problem still exists... and are rickshaws a thing in goa like in the bigger cities?

\- is renting a car at the age of 22 usually possible in both goa and kerala? (with an international driver's license of course) and are there any special things to watch out for? (f.e. do the rental companies usually offer insurance packages and dash cams?)

\- how safe would that train route be? especially the night route from udupi to kochi? (i usually carry a few expensive electronic devices with me in a large backpack, when i travel)

\- since the legal drinking age in kerala is 23, is it strictly enforced? i usually like to have a beer here and there in a bar but unfortunately am only close to being 23 when we are in kl. (dui is not an option tho, so no worries haha)

\- is periyar national park worth it to see wild elephants or are there better options?

\- anything else i am missing? (unlike the usual things like no tap water, no peeled fruits, no vapes,... haha)

posting here to vent and warn anyone considering a major appliance purchase in bengaluru. i'm currently in the middle of a customer service black hole with samsung and i'm at my wit's end.

we were excited to get a new samsung washing machine delivered on **august 30th**. that excitement lasted about five minutes.

here’s the timeline of the circus so far:

* **aug 30 (friday):** machine is installed. the technician rushes through it and leaves. we discover it’s doa (dead on arrival) – it won't even draw water.
* **sep 1 (sunday):** after a 2-day wait, a technician finally visits. he tinkers with it, fails to complete a single cycle, and leaves. the machine now has a *new* problem: it won't expel water. so he actually made it worse.
* **sep 1-2 (sun-mon):** we call the technician, who, without visiting, decides it must be our ""electric supply socket"" and tells us to replace it. we spent the next day on multiple calls to the installation center insisting that our power supply is perfectly fine.
* **sep 3 (wednesday):** we get a confirmed appointment for 3:50 pm. we clear our schedules and wait. and wait. **complete no-show. no call, no text, no apology.** we tried calling the assigned engineer multiple times, but no response.
* **sep 4 (thursday):** after we escalate (again), a different guy shows up at 4 pm. he looks at the machine and says he'll be back *tomorrow* (today) to fix it.
* **sep 5 (today, friday):** surprise, surprise... another **no-show**. when we called him, he just said he'd come ""tomorrow."" fed up, we called samsung's main customer care line to escalate further. their ""solution""? they told us our service update was for a technician to visit on **september 8th!** another three-day wait, scheduled without even asking us.

so now i have a brand new, expensive samsung machine sitting in my home like a 40kg paperweight. we've wasted hours chasing people down, only to be met with incompetence and broken promises.

has anyone else in bengaluru (especially marathahalli area) faced this kind of service from samsung? is there a magic word to get them to just take back their defective product and issue a refund? i'm done with repairs.

**tl;dr:** bought a new samsung machine. it was dead on arrival. the service experience has been a cascade of failures: multiple no-shows, incorrect remote diagnoses, and technicians who either make the problem worse or don't show up at all. now stuck with a dead machine for over a week and samsung thinks a service date of sep 8th is acceptable."

this is purely meant as public service, and he is looking to create a proper non-profit or charity. 

now as good as it sounds, us friends were discussing what may be required, and importantly if anything could go wrong - as none of us have any experience in this. 

all advice is welcome, but here are a few questions for all - 

1. can anyone open a clinic of this kind or does one need to be a doctor, or is there any particular licensing requirement? 

2. what sort of structure and entity is best suited to ensure donor privacy + accounting transparency 

3. how does one get medicines at preferential rates?

7. how does one source medical equipment like ultrasound, x ray etc considering these aren’t sold off the shelf. 

8. are there any doctors who we could tie up with or get more direction and info from?

reddit,2025-09-06 19:37:29,"the invisible backbone of our cities every morning when i leave for work, there’s a security guard at the gate of my apartment. rain, heat, winter, he’s always there. he gives a half-hearted salute when residents walk past, but most of us just nod and move on. some don’t even look at him.

last week, i came home late and found him eating dinner, two dry rotis and some pickle, sitting on the floor with a small torch propped up against the wall. no table, no chair, no fan. just him and the silence of the night.

i asked him where his family was. he smiled and said, “gaon mein hai, bachchon ki padhaai chal rahi hai. yahan se paisa bhejta hoon.”
(they’re in the village, the kids are studying. i send money from here.)

think about that, his entire life in the city revolves around guarding the homes of people who don’t even know his first name.

and it’s not just him. it’s the woman who sweeps our colony road before sunrise. the delivery guy who races against time, fighting traffic and rain, just so we can eat. the garbage collector who climbs three floors without a lift, carrying our waste on his back.

they are everywhere. yet, somehow, invisible.

we get angry if a parcel is late, if the guard doesn’t open the gate fast enough, if the maid takes a day off. but do we ever stop to ask if they’re okay?

a few months ago, a kid in our society collapsed while playing. before anyone else reacted, it was the same guard who rushed him to the hospital on his own bike. no hesitation, no thought of “not my job.” that child is alive today because of him.

and yet tomorrow morning, most of us will still walk past without even a “good morning.”

our so-called “india growth story” is built on the backs of people like them. people who sacrifice comfort, family, and dignity so the rest of us can chase our dreams. and yet, they’ll never trend, never get headlines, never be invited to panels or award shows.

they’ll just keep showing up every day, quietly doing their jobs, while the world walks past without a second glance.

maybe the least we can do,  the very least, is to notice them. to thank them. to remember that behind every delivery, every gate opened, every clean street, there’s a human being giving up pieces of their own life so ours can run smoothly."

casteism is still alive and kicking. people pretend it’s gone in cities, but the moment marriage comes up, suddenly “honour” matters. inter-caste couples get harassed or even killed and people online support honour killings. how is love, the most basic human connection, something to punish?
sex education? a joke here. the second someone brings it up, people scream “against our culture.” meanwhile, every kid has porn on their phone shaping toxic, unrealistic ideas about relationships. studies show proper sex ed reduces assaults and builds healthier attitudes. but here, shame counts as “culture.”
then there’s purity culture. men’s virginity? doesn’t matter. women’s virginity? apparently her whole worth. the hypocrisy is unbearable.
and being a woman here is constant paranoia,
watching what i wear, checking behind me at night ,parents panicking if i’m late.
tell me, how is this freedom?
zooming out, the bigger picture is just as bleak. politicians don’t care. roads are broken, the air is poison, school fees ridiculous, and even government exams (like ssc) are riddled with scams. thousands of students’ futures at stake, and they can’t even conduct an exam properly. meanwhile, the rich climb higher while the middle class and poor suffocate.
and as citizens, we’re no better. we trash roads, dump garbage in rivers we call “sacred,” blast loudspeakers without caring. i saw a girl online get abused just for calling out noise pollution. near my house, prayers and religious songs blast at 5 am every morning. neighbours hate it, but no one dares complain ,because religion always trumps reason.
instead of moving forward with science, we’re sliding back into superstition. politicians teaching kids that hanuman was the first astronaut. black magic, pseudoscience, rituals  this is what we’re passing to the next generation. how are we supposed to compete globally with this mindset?
layer after layer of dysfunction.
and it feels like no one truly loves this country. patriotism only shows up on republic day, independence day, or during an india pakistan match. but when it comes to actually improving things? silence.
i’m not saying this out of nowhere. a lot comes from what i see around me, plus interviews and news from channels like the print on youtube, creators like umrah husain, and countless other videos/social media.
so i’m asking,
 do you ever feel this hopelessness about the country?
 and if yes, how do you cope? because right now, it feels crushing for me and what can we as the present generation ,do to improve the situation?"

guilty as charged. i complain about bmtc buses but use them daily. curse bescom but have 24/7 power (mostly). hate zomato delivery charges but order dinner anyway.

not saying we shouldn't demand better roads or governance. just wondering if we bangaloreans are a bit too pessimistic sometimes?

anyone else think we take the good parts of namma bengaluru for granted? or am i just being too optimistic after too much filter coffee? ☕"

i need your help to get the word out.

my pg owner found a dog near high street in hsr. the poor thing is a bit injured and had wandered onto the street looking for shelter. he is now tied at our pg gate and being given food and water. he is very cute, and friendly. came with a collar already and he clearly looks like someone’s pet who must be missing him badly.

the problem is that while my pg owner has taken him in for shelter, they are not the nicest . they keep him tied to the gate all day and he cries a lot . no emotional support, instead pg owner shouts at him if he cries .

since i recently moved from mumbai there’s no point in me sharing on my instagram or whatsapp stories, but if people who live in bangalore can do it, especially in areas near hsr, please do . maybe we can find the owners. and even if we cannot find the original owner and if anyone is open to adoption or fostering please connect with me. this sweet boy really deserves to be in a safe and loving home.

thank you for reading and for helping spread the word. 🐶💙"

reddit,2025-09-08 17:47:58,"got scammed by ecombooks selling pirated books on amazon bought what i thought was a real copy of ""understanding deep learning"" from ecombooks on amazon. turns out they're selling photocopied fakes, every page literally has ""draft"" written at the bottom.

the book i got was complete garbage - print quality looked like a bad photocopy, figures were supposed to be in color and it was obviously fake. these guys are charging almost full price for stolen content.

what really gets me is how common this is. search any popular textbook on amazon india and you'll find tons of sellers doing this same shit. they call them ""economy editions"" or ""low cost editions"" but it's just piracy with extra steps.

this sucks for everyone:

* authors get nothing for their work
* we get crappy books that might have missing pages
* real bookstores can't compete with thieves
* students waste money on useless copies

**good news:** amazon customer service was actually amazing. they approved my refund right away, no hassle at all (still processing but should be done in 24 hours). the support person was really helpful and said they'd investigate the seller. honestly, 10/10 for their customer service team.

but amazon really needs to fix this seller problem. these pirates aren't even hiding - they're right there selling fake books openly.

**warning to everyone:** stay away from ecombooks. if you see books way cheaper than usual or labeled as ""draft copy"" - it's probably fake. check seller reviews before buying anything.

pls report these sellers when you find them. it's the only way to stop this nonsense.

**tl;dr:** ecombooks sold me a fake book on amazon. refund approved immediately by amazon support (processing now), but these pirated book sellers are everywhere on the platform. don't buy from ecombooks or any seller offering suspiciously cheap."

reddit,2025-09-09 15:36:28,"rant : i was coming back home from coaching and saw 5 accidents within 40 minutes span usually it take me 15-20 minutes to drive back home but couple times it extended to like 50 minutes on days when the traffic lights aren't working or theres traffic due to heavy rain and stuff. it doesn't bother me at all. i live in patiala, punjab. there has been maintainance work going around in the city - roads, sewerage and idk more. but because of that they have been blocking roads and switching the two lane traffic into single lane. it has been happening for past two to three weeks now and still going on. because of that the traffic has been slightly more but still okay, nothing too serious.  
however today i saw like 5 accidents at same place. first i noticed a car straight up slam an e rikshaw from behind because ttraffic light turned red for them but they couldnt move forward and allow others (me) go because of the no way out traffic ahead cuz couple chuttiyas fucking parked their car in a narrow alley like???? tum log soch kar bhi park karte ho kya  
then at the intersection of like three major roads (including highway), i saw some labourer on his old shabby looking bicycle trying to get thru the traffic where none gave a shit abt traffic light. like actually no one gaf. they just kept going on and on, nobody stopping because oh ""mere akele ke karan aisa kya hi hoga"". i saw his slipper fall off his feet but he couldn't even turn back. a car crashed into an e rikshaw that was breaking rule next to him. and if he didn't move forward, some impatient looking aunty was going to hit him with her scooty. the very dedicated, resilient, and committed to public safety traffic police man finally got up from his tea break when he saw the car crash. but instead of taking care of the visible traffic jam where each side was breaking rule out of frustration, he went on to yell at the car driver who technically was not at fault. the honks all around me were so fucking loud it almost made my ears bleed bro. i somehow got out of there when i saw the traffic light turn green for me. it took me 3 green lights (like good 7 minutes) to just turn right and get out of the roads intersection.   
then at other intersection i saw another crash between an e rikshaw and car. the e rikshaw flipped over this time injuring the driver :/   
finally after driving another eight ish minutes i reached my final turn at another intersection where i saw three girls almost getting hit by a truck. one fell down from the shock and fear. and everyone behind and the truck just kept honking and honking.   
i somehow reached home. it'll be dreadful to drive back home this whole week and maybe next week too because they once again switched double lane traffic to single lane. i can't even take the right turn at final intersection anymore due to potential chance of getting blown up by some car or the truck like it happened with the girls today. i would have to drive further ahead, turn 10 more times into different lanes so i can just get back home. look, i wouldn't mind if the work done was actually good. dude what the heck did they fix. i saw the new roads already having potholes and breaking. it's not even been a good one week since they were made! why don't they just invest into better materials and building better streets like in other countries rather than the same cheap concrete. i see nobody stopping before zebra crossing. everyone thinks they're meant to cross the zebra crossing. why don't they fix the stupid potholes literally in every street and the highway. why don't they make parking laws stricter or make the traffic police actually do their job. everytime i see those men, they're always on their phones or drinking tea. i swear ive seen one of them fucking flirting with some woman instead of managing the traffic on a rainy day once when even the lights weren't working. this is genuinely annoying. i feel so exhausted after coming back home every single day because of this hectic drive and i am sure this is the condition in almost every other city with every other indian person here :/ what even are my parents paying taxes for"

fundamentals of ayurveda &gt;&gt;

dosha (vata,pitta,kapha) – basically india’s version of the discarded humoral theory,which can't be measured or seen but if they're vitiated in body they cause disease even if its cancer,fever..tuberculosis etc..

dhatu (rasa &gt; rakta(blood)&gt;mamsa(muscle) &gt;meda(fat)&gt;asthi(bones) &gt;majja &gt;shukra (semen)
means preceding one forms the next🙂).

agni , it's a some invisible body fire that’s supposed to control all metabolism.
cramming shlokas like we are supposed to chant in front of patients and cure them 🤡

acharyas contradicting each other in the texts, instead of a single evidence based conclusion.you all know popular contradiction in ayurveda 360 bones and modern 206 but there are many such things(like around 20 types of fever are mentioned in ayurveda and one type is actually caused by bhoot,pret,using beautiful women for tuberculosis treatment while maintaining celibacy etc.i have to write my own samhita with the title ""flaws of sushrutha/charaka samhita🤡 ) but we actually need to cram for exams to memorize the stupidity of acharyas i guess and many bs theories present in it said by our proffesors themselves.

yet we’re told to mug it all up, as if rote learning will suddenly make pseudoscience into science.even if you know what you're studying is bs,nothing we can do 

last month was my birthday. my parents came to meet me,i broke down completely. i cried in front of them and asked to be taken to a psychiatrist because i couldn’t handle this course anymore.

psychiatrist  first said: just discontinue the course and pursue something else.  i thought someone finally understood me.

but then my father said: he’s not talking properly these days...the psychiatrist just started defending ayurveda like

“allopathy has so many side effects.”
ayurveda is 100% natural."" 
( just because side effects aren’t discovered doesn’t mean they don’t exist).

“what your mother gives as kashaya is ayurveda. every coconut, groundnut oil, every home remedy that’s ayurveda.”


like… wtf food and water are they also ayurveda?and if side effects aren’t even studied properly, how is that a defense?
after all these he said ""idk about ayurveda but you should study instead of making these excuses""

he ended by prescribing escitalopram and telling me to “study well, you’re troubling your parents.”i didn't say anything...this  depressed me further

two mbbs students sitting there also added: “first year is always tough, later it’ll be fine.” as if one day the concepts of dosha, dhatu, agni, and atma will magically turn into modern pharmacology.

it became the worst day of my life even tried of sui*cide who's gonna explain them.


i keep dragging myself through this course, but every day i feel more hopeless. my parents want me to “practice ayurveda” after this, but i cannot imagine wasting 5.5 years of my life cramming shlokas and pushing treatments that even science has rejected.


i know i'm dumb and delusional but at least not that to belive in our body and universe made of akasha,vayu,agni,jala,prithvi and there is no fire sitting inside stomach and our body is much complicated than 3 dosha...

don’t know what my future looks like anymore.i have no one to share my problems all my friends are brainwased and try to brainwash me too also parents think that its gold mine next to mbbs and i no longer have faith in so called god.i just needed to write this all out...i can't bear this guilt for 5.5years"

i have an apartment in bellandur with a khata and with all the confusion of e khata that's happened in the last year or so, i had been reading multiple reports and suggestions on how to obtain it.
couple of months back, i tried the k gov website that was supposed to do it for you but got stuck at some point and upon calling my aro, he told me to visit bbmp office. i procrastinated for a couple of months but finally got around to asking my bbmp guy (who's done my khata, name transfers etc. for a fee of course) to get the e khata done. he straight up asked me for 15k. which was like a slap in the face coz the whole point of e khata was to digitize the khatas that you already had. 

anyways, i asked around and a friend of mine suggested to try bangalore one in hsr since that place had helped him get it done for peanuts. 

i visited the place today afternoon around 12 with 5 docs that my friend told me to take along: 
1. a khata
2. sale deed 
3. property photo (just a main gate photo with buikding, took it off google) 
4. electricity bill
5. property tax receipt

reddit,2025-09-12 19:25:48,"a third of women describe being sexually harassed on the road. how safe are auto-rickshaws? **the sky was** crashing down the morning of august 14th, as the 19-year-old girl approached an auto-rickshaw that she saw had been waiting for one more passenger to start off. it was the only one in sight. the backseat was crammed, but she had a test that day, and needed to catch the metro. she got up in the front seat beside the driver.

a few minutes into the ride, she felt the driver’s elbow press against her breasts. she shifted away, uneasy, and pulled her backpack up as a barrier. he pressed against it anyway. she realized he was doing it on purpose.

when she tried to resist, he grabbed her thigh and yanked her closer. she froze.

after a passenger got off, she moved into the back. eventually, the other seats emptied, and before long, it was only her and the driver. he refused to go further unless she agreed to a higher fare. this sort of bullying tactic is a shared experience amongst day-to-day commuters. you either pay, or you walk. it was raining harder now and the streets were blurred. in the next few hours, the rain would [disrupt traffic](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/heavy-rain-hits-delhi-ncr-ahead-of-independence-day-triggers-waterlogging-and-traffic-disruptions-in-several-areas/articleshow/123293561.cms) throughout the national capital region of india.

she agreed.

en route, the driver tried to strike up a conversation. he asked about her college. she answered, as vaguely as possible — “d.u.”

at her stop, she handed him a 200-rupee note. she hadn’t had any change. the driver kept it, and asked for 100 more — a total of 300 rupees. she didn’t know what to do at this point and blurted out that she knew what he had done to her, but she didn’t want to escalate, and asked him to return 100 rupees. he refused. she pleaded for at least 50 back. he returned her 40, saying he had no 10-rupee note.

later that morning, she posted about the incident on r/india, the country’s largest left-leaning subreddit, which had just marked the 79th independence day. many users asked whether she had taken a picture of his license plate. she hadn’t.

she fears retaliation if she tries to “call him out” — including acid attacks and rape — which is what several desperate men did to women, when they turned down their sexual advances. she recalled how the auto-operator kept staring at her face the whole ride. he knew where she lives, and might as well have figured out the route she takes to her college.

others in the thread said she should have screamed, or that they would have fought back — had it happened to them. one male survivor wrote that when it happened to him, his mind went blank.

i texted her later that day, with a few resources and the number of a social worker. but she never replied.

**had she answered**, among the key questions that i’d have asked: why didn’t she feel safe to go to the police, and file a complaint? why hadn’t she thought of calling the women’s helpline? and why not report it to her university?

surely, it couldn’t have been that difficult for the authorities to pull cctv footage and identify the perpetrator.

plus, at 19, most students in india live with their parents, who hold enormous sway over what their adult children can and cannot do. why didn’t she turn to them, instead of confiding in reddit?

analyzing a number of such experiences reveals the pattern: in indian societies, the first question people ask a victim of sexual harassment is — what were you wearing that made him act like that?

a 20-year-old woman — whom i’ll call s — recounted a similar story.

one night, she and her mother were riding home in an auto-rickshaw. halfway through a dark alley, the driver stopped, said there was a problem, and began to fix something under his seat. then he apologized, and asked s to hold something that felt like a rope. she did as he asked, and the next thing she sensed was an arm rubbing up on her thigh. she let go of the rope and told her mother to hold it instead. “don’t be stupid,” her mother beseeched.

she picked up the rope. and again, he groped her. he then tried to touch her chest. “i froze. he fucking smirked at me and asked to hold it properly,” she said. “when i told my mother, she yelled at me.”

she shoved him and stepped out. “my mother shouted at me to get in,” she said. “and he just kept smirking.” she told her mother she’d walk home herself and she could stay if she wanted.

at home, she told her mother what had happened, and why she was acting that way. but instead of consoling her, she got angry. “she warned me not to tell anyone — especially my father,” the young woman said. these things happen with women, her mother told her, and advised to wear a kurti next time.

“i was wearing jeans and a full-sleeved top,” she wrote. “it wasn’t my clothes and it wasn’t my fault.”

**in his 2020 study** on sexual harassment in chennai, michael l. valan [found that](https://doi.org/10.1177/2516606920927303) 35 per cent of 530 women quizzed had been victims of some form of sexual harassment in public transport, including groping. similar surveys by the world bank [estimated the number](https://doi.org/10.1177/2516606920927303) to be higher: in delhi, 88 per cent of women alleged sexual harassment in public transport. in chennai, pune and mumbai it was well over 50 per cent.

according to l. valan, 81 per cent of the victims were between the age group 18–22. 73 per cent of the young women said they were scared at the time of violation — the majority of which occurred in rush hours, on their way to work, college, or home. over half of them decided to walk away, and 12 per cent stared back at the offender — all of whom were strangers. only 6.5 per cent of them lodged a police complaint.

but these figures only cover buses, trains, and taxis. there are no firm statistics on how often women are sexually harassed in auto-rickshaws. the government of india collects no such data in any of these. law enforcement also doesn’t require to keep records of where the victim was harassed — only the various forms of harassment. the central motor act, in fact, with all its amendments, does not even mention auto-rickshaws.

section 75 of the bharatiya nyaya sanhita (bns), lists [specific acts](https://devgan.in/bns/section/75/) by men, such as, “physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures,” as sexual harassment, punishable with up to three years of imprisonment — or with fine, or with both. but there is no separate law to deal with harassment on public transportation.

as of early september, the national commission for women had recorded 1,565 complaints of molestation or outraging a woman’s modesty; 1,447 cases of rape or attempted rape; 1,033 of sexual harassment; and 920 complaints of police apathy toward women.

the numbers are a conservative record of reality. studies show that only 1–6 percent of those harassed ever go to the police. dr. disari roy, assistant professor of women’s studies at diamond harbour women’s university, says a vast number of cases go unreported under pressure from patriarchal family values — because of the shame if families find out, and the fear of retaliation.

in the end, s chose to keep quiet for the same reasons. “had my father found out,” she said, “he’d never let me go out again.”

“this normalizes harassment as part of women’s everyday life,” dr. roy told me recently. “it keeps the cycle going.”

the nature of the crime also makes it difficult to document. did it happen? — yes. but when it’s a man leaning too close, angling his pelvis such that every bump of the ride presses him against her body, or stroking her arm while exchanging money and tickets — each gesture can be dismissed as accidental. when confronted, the harasser would feign obliviousness and deny their intent. other acts, like groping, leave less room for denial. this, of course, leads to a follow up question; a better one: if it didn’t happen, what are the chances that a woman would fabricate such an allegation in a culture that blames the victim and barely acknowledges sex?

the ambiguities are part of the reasons why women harassed in transit are less likely to file complaints than women harassed in other circumstances.

other surveys — beyond the sub-continent — listed the lack of system credibility as one of the main reasons why women do not seek legal help, which applies to this country too. several women told me they had not reported because they thought the police wouldn’t believe them.

in 2012, abhishek bhalla and g. vishnu of the tehelka, an investigative magazine, [posed as research scholars](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-and-around-delhi-cops-blame-rapes-on-women-tehelka-investigation-with-ndtv-475442) and spoke with more than 30 police officers from two dozen police stations across the national capital region. over half of them showed clear gender bias and insisted that sexual assault and rape aren't especially common in the region. “only 10 per cent are real, forced rapes,“ a sub-inspector of sector 40, gurgaon, told them. “10 per cent are genuine.” another officer dismissed media reports and asked them to stick to the facts. he estimated it to be 1–2 per cent.

rape victims were often viewed with skepticism. “if a girl asks for a birthday party, and she’s alone with two or three boys, and they’re drinking; she knows what’s likely to happen,” one officer said. “if she still choose to be there, she has no right to call it rape.” it’s the good-woman, bad-woman rhetoric: step out of stereo-typically appropriate behavior, and you are labeled bad.

another officer described allegations of rape as a lucrative business for women. “everyone knows,” he said. the claim that money is the biggest factor in rape cases, was also repeated by the only female investigating officer the reporters spoke with.

authorities further blamed the victims. “if girls don’t dress decently, men naturally feel attracted,” a sub-inspector of greater noida surmised. “it makes them just do it.” there were also frequent stereotypical remarks, and ethnic prejudices among officers.

tehelka summarized the conundrum: police believed women are raped because of their own behavior.

when families and formal systems so routinely cast doubt on women’s accounts, the disbelief seeps inward: many begin to downplay sexual harassment as a “social nuisance” that they have to put up with. “there is also a lot of inconvenience, time and energy required in reporting a crime and subsequent follow ups,” one study observed.

many stay quiet to avoid making a scene. “he was friendly with everyone else. i knew no one would believe me,” a friend told me about the creepy stares she got from an older man through her entire train ride.

others have no clear idea of where to report abuse — or how to access medical and legal support once they do. a 2022 study by the world bank [found that](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099630010202217290/pdf/idu08bcf65ff0ec9204d3f0bda6046ccc305aef5.pdf) 75 per cent of women railway commuters in mumbai were unaware of women helpline numbers. (india has 3 national hotlines, plus each state operates its own.)

**auto-rickshaws are** one of the most common ways to get around in indian cities. they are essential for last-mile travel as major transit stops are often more than a walk away from home or work. auto-operators, who are almost always men, queue their three-wheelers outside these stops, and frequently carry more than five passengers at a time.

how they operate varies from place to place, depending on the local laws. in kolkata, for instance, they operate within a fixed route permitted by the regional transport authorities, while in delhi, they operate on meter basis and have no fixed route. according to the latest [economic survey of delhi](https://delhiplanning.delhi.gov.in/sites/default/files/planning/economic_survey_of_delhi_2023-24_english.pdf) (2023–2024), the number of auto-rickshaws in the period were a little above 93 thousands — down from 1,98 thousands in 2015–2016. (a large number of other passenger vehicles operate within the city.)

mostly, people of the middle-income category, with an average monthly earning between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, commute through auto-rickshaws. at times, private vehicle owners also prefer autos. the drivers earn less, around ₹10,000 to ₹15,000 a month; they work all seven days a week, for punishingly long hours, and rarely take leaves. but money is only one axis of difference. “public transportation systems operate as a zone of contact between diverse social groups in the city,” romit chowdhury wrote in [*city of men: masculinities and everyday morality on public transport*](https://share.google/wdvvastjwhqptck0x), which provides a detailed account of kolkata’s auto- and taxi-drivers — based on 18 months of interviews with them.

they are not gender neutral zones. these rides are shaped by, what he called, the “gendered politics of copresence,” where “masculinity operates as an invisible structuring principle.” in other words, men set the rules.

nearly all the drivers romit spoke to were aware of how women are harassed in public spaces, especially inside an auto-rickshaw. most of them said they step in as soon as they notice inappropriate touching; others admitted they wait until the woman speaks up. “if the woman does not object, it is not right for us to say anything,” one auto-driver told him. “but if the woman raises an objection then we chime in and say, ’please sit properly’.”

another driver said he always carries a stick, and acknowledged that, at times, it’s the drivers themselves who are the harassers. “there are some drivers too whose left arm is diseased,” one driver said. “i ask them too: brother, is your left elbow alright? i’m sure they don’t leave any women.”

“but precisely what about sexual harassment makes it seem wrong to them,” romit noted, “was because the woman is someone’s sister, daughter or wife, and therefore needs to be given due respect,” even as many of them insisted that woman also has the right to consent.

––

**one evening**, a 20-year-old woman in mumbai was walking home from work. she had only been in the city a few weeks, on a short internship. an auto-rickshaw pulled up, and she got in, like she always did.

a few meters down the road, a man — whom she assumed was the driver’s acquaintance — climbed in, and sat right next to her. he began asking strange questions, such as her name and where she worked — even though they had never met. she lied about her name. but when he asked if she worked at xyz company, she couldn’t keep up the lie, and said:

“yes.”

“what do you do?”

“internship,” she told him.

he prodded her waist, and asked to share her contact number. she was starting to feel uneasy. she tried calling her mother, but the call didn’t go through. he continued to act creepy, and after a few minutes they dropped her on the side of an interior road without charging money.

she dialed up her mom again, and told her she’s walking back home. on the way, she talked with her best friend about the encounter through voice notes — and later, posted it online.

a quick web search for “sexual harassment in auto-rickshaw” digs up dozens of cases. the first three i found are:

in 2018, a delhi student was molested by an auto-driver. she called the police many times, but no one showed up. shortly after, she posted about the incident on twitter. and the authorities took action. a case was filed against the auto-driver, and two policemen [were suspended](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/jamia-student-molested-by-auto-driver-policemen-suspended-118051101367_1.html) for their delayed response.

in 2020, an 18-year-old college student in mumbai posted a video of a driver masturbating while staring at her through the rear-view mirror. he refused to stop the vehicle despite her repeated protests. mumbai police reviewed the footage, and filed a case at the local police station. the man was later [arrested](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/auto-driver-held-for-sexually-harassing-student-in-vehicle/article30967404.ece).

this march, in thakurpukur, kolkata, an auto-rickshaw driver [was arrested](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/auto-rickshaw-driver-arrested-for-allegedly-harassing-minor-in-kolkata-/articleshow/119435437.cms) following an extensive manhunt and analysis of cctv footage. he had attempted “serious sexual offenses” against a 15-year-old girl, as she was returning home from her evening classes.

the pattern is obvious: it’s always a young woman traveling alone — or the only female in the auto — as she is harassed, either by fellow passengers, or by the driver himself. sometimes she resists; sometimes she can’t. and the perpetrator continues until she manages to get off.

**the 2012 nationwide** protests over the gruesome, highly publicized [gang-rape and murder of jyoti singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_delhi_gang_rape_and_murder) — a 22-year-old physiotherapy intern — became one of the most defining upheavals of modern indian life.

in the aftermath, both central and state governments announced a series of measures to safeguard women commuters. among them was a gender-sensitization program for public service vehicle drivers in delhi, including auto-rickshaw operators.

the program was run by the manas foundation, a mental health ngo, in partnership with delhi authorities. it was a two-hour course with interactive media and had open question-and-answer sessions. drivers who enrolled in it often admitted that their stereotypical thought-process was the reason women feel unsafe — and that it would have to change. by 2014, delhi required all drivers to complete the course to receive the fitness certificate.

then, on october 20, 2023, the transport department abruptly revoked the manas foundation’s authorization. officials [cited](https://theprint.in/india/delhi-govt-temporarily-withdraws-authorisation-of-organisation-conducting-gender-sensitisation-sessions-for-drivers/1816041/) delays in issuing certificates as the reason, and said it caused a bureaucratic hurdle throughout the process. per local news, there was supposed to be an online version of the course. but i could not find anything. (manas foundation did not respond to my requests for comment.)

since the past decade, a number of indian cities have rolled out pink auto-rickshaws to provide a women-only service. local governments in power often permitted drivers of either sex — albeit with better background checks.

and yet, the results were uneven. routes were often misaligned with actual demand. in allahabad, for instance, the designated routes bypassed schools, offices and commercial centers. the ridership dropped, and the vehicles ran half-empty. by 2019, according to union leader vinod chandra dubey, the scheme was unsustainable. the expansion of private two-wheelers among women further undercut demand. and so, the plan never gained traction, he [told the times of india](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/but-pink-autos-fail-to-lure-customers/articleshow/72495769.cms).

the story is much the same elsewhere. pink auto-rickshaws have either been rolled back entirely or reduced to such few numbers that you might spend a month in these cities, and never see one.

**in her 2025 paper**, “[*challenges of pink (women) auto drivers*](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5287251),” neha prasad, a research scholar in the department of economics at ranchi university, observed that most pro-women schemes fail because of flawed design and inadequate implementation.

ranchi was the first city to introduce pink autos. but it was not a government initiative. in 2013, a local entrepreneur named sanjay sahu began training women from lower socio-economic backgrounds. he trained around 50 — free of charge — and helped them obtain commercial licenses.

of these women, 24 still drive pink autos; 14 had left after repeated harassment. sanjay had also recently stopped the training program because of declining health. no government office or ngo has stepped in to continue it.

neha found that nearly half of these auto-drivers were single mothers. the rest lived with their husbands. most had come from neighboring states. they lacked food security cards, and had only partial access to social welfare schemes.

and yet, all of them earned more than they had in previous jobs, and for the first time, had steady incomes.

among them, neha observed, the biggest challenge is in the form of harassment from male colleagues. auto-unions, run entirely by men, blocked women from regular stands and imposed an unlawful restriction that they could carry only female passengers. this slashed their ridership and earnings, since they had to turn away women travelling with men.

this is hardly unusual.

in 2017, ndtv [filmed](https://youtu.be/5-xydrgmo3c?si=08s7rocmaictoca2) a protest outside a police station in thane; auto-drivers had gathered after one of them was arrested for hurling sexual slurs at a woman driver. asked whether women should be driving auto-rickshaws, their collective reply was: “no they shouldn’t.”

“family and social taboos are often cited, even though there’s no evidence they affect women drivers,” neha told me recently. more pressing, she said, are structural and institutional barriers that remain largely unexplored.

for instance, instead of easy access to loans at cheaper rates, licenses, or route permits, women auto-drivers face extra scrutiny and arbitrary rules that their male counterparts do not. in ranchi, local officials have mostly looked the other way, partly because meddling in auto-union affairs carries political consequences.

but, neha added, that it would be misleading to assume that the government or administration is entirely apathetic; more often, genuine systemic obstacles stand in the way of effective intervention.

she urged the government to step in and fix these enforcement gaps, pointing out that more pink autos means more safety for women in public.

**news coverage** of sexual harassment cases largely focuses on whether the police have managed to arrest the perpetrator or not. little is said about what goes on inside the victim’s head — the intrusive thoughts, and the sleepless nights that come after.

how does she feel?

a 2024 [study](https://doi.org/10.26911/jepublichealth.2024.09.04.10) on the effects of harassment of women in chennai’s public transport suggested a score of 24 on the impact of event scale–revised as the threshold beyond which the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder and depression becomes significant. survivors averaged 33. in cases of physical harassment, such as groping, the mean rose to 58.

according to kaitlin a chivens-wilson, [writing in 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18523613/) in the *mcgill journal of medicine*, survivors of all types of sexual violence go through, what experts call, the rape trauma syndrome (rts).

rts unfolds in three phases, starting with the acute phase; the survivor shakes, cries, and yells. but they can appear “outwardly calm and subdued” as well, chivens-wilson wrote.

next comes the pretense of normal life — the outward adjustment phase. with a high level of denial, the survivors distract themselves through ordinary routine.

in the final phase — long-term reorganization — the survivors confront the memory of assault and attempt to live with what happened. they “integrate the assault into their view of themselves and resolve their feelings about the assailant,” chivens-wilson explained.

**intense psychological trauma** such as sexual abuse fucks up how our body normally respond to stress. it increases levels of corticotropin releasing hormone (crh), which in turn stimulate the release of cortisol — the primary stress hormone, and also a major hormone of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis that regulates body functions and controls the neural, endocrine and immune system.

under normal conditions, a negative feedback loop inhibits cortisol by acting at the hypothalamic and pituitary levels. but trauma disrupts this regulatory mechanism, and reduces pituitary sensitivity to crh. an increased level of cortisol dysregulates neural systems causing inappropriate fear reactions and persistent mild depression among victims.

sexual harassment in young adults leaves deeper marks. they live with a mix of shame, guilt, anxiety, and anger.

that day, after s was harassed while she was returning home with her mother — she showered ten times. but she still felt like it wouldn’t go away. “i can feel his hands all over my body. i get nightmares about it,” she wrote. “i feel miserable. i feel so, so bad. i hate it, i hate her, i hate being a woman.”

she also didn’t receive support from her mother, which only made those feelings stronger, and more harmful.

“i can’t stop crying when i think about it,” she said at the end of her post. “i honestly don’t know what to do.”

according to chivens-wilson, many women who told about their assault to others often experienced secondary victimization. she added that seeking help from professionals without any prior training in sexual assault trauma can increase psychological and physical distress, too, as they have a tendency toward victim-blaming behaviors.

“in india, police aren’t trained to deal with trauma,” a spokeswoman from majlis law, a mumbai-based non-profit that provides legal aid to victims of sexual and domestic abuse, told me.

between 2017 and 2020, and again in 2024 and 2025, the national commission for women [conducted](https://www.ncw.gov.in/ncw-cells/new-initiative-cell/) 31 gender-sensitization workshops for police officers across the country. the commission has further trained 1,031 officers in partnership with the bureau of police research and development. but the efforts remain far from adequate. i couldn’t find any statistics to suggest whether any of it has changed how officers behave.

meanwhile, constables and head constables, who make up the bulk of india’s police force and are usually the first to meet victims, remain untrained in most cases.

even in 2000, when the national commission for women introduced the country’s first [gender-sensitization curriculum for police](https://cdn.ncw.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gender-sensitization-of-police-officers.pdf), it warned that training so many constables at the district level was impossible. training, it said, would need to be decentralized — taken down to sub-divisions and police stations.

for survivors, the situation is even bleaker. india has no national system of counseling or therapy. “one stop centers exist, but there is no real framework to provide counseling to survivors,” the spokeswoman from majlis law said.

in absence of formal support, survivors often turn to informal networks. online forums such as reddit and [safecity](https://webapp.safecity.in/) have become popular among indian women to share their experiences of sexual harassment.

safecity, created by the non-profit organization red dot foundation, collects reports of harassment in public spaces. each entry, that can be anonymous, is plotted over a google map. about 40,000 such dots have been plotted so far. the dots appear as clusters, and reveal patterns that can be valuable to “what people would rather not see,” safecity states in its description, “and a tool for those who must decide what to do about it.”

**the truth is** that women are just as likely to be sexually harassed in auto-rickshaws as on any other vehicle. some of the reasons often thought to make public transports such as buses safer — higher numbers of passengers, and the presence of other women — can just easily work against them. over-boarding, for instance, means more accidental contact, and more opportunities to harass.

in delhi, a 2016 study by manish madan and mahesh k. nalla [found that](https://doi.org/10.1177/1057567716639093) 79.2 per cent of female respondents had experienced sexual harassment at bus stops. in taxis or auto-rickshaws, the number was significantly lower: 38 per cent. and yet, the perceived likelihood of harassment was equal in either seetings — at above 85 per cent.

“a woman passenger is likely to have identifying information about the [taxi or auto] driver,” the authors explained, “creating fewer opportunities for victimization.” she’ll also likely be able to use her mobile phone and call someone, or share her location. a taxi or auto-driver, who depends on the profession for their livelihood, will likely see this as a high-risk situation, the authors said. the threat of being caught and potentially losing his income may lead him to make the “rational decision” not to harass a passenger.

but the result has a blind spot: it doesn’t adjust for exposure. it says nothing about risk per trip, or about how often women use each mode of transport.

put it this way: the data can’t tell you whether one auto ride is riskier than one bus ride. perhaps, autos look safer because fewer women use them. (a 2021 [survey](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41027-021-00313-1) showed that 3 times as many women in delhi preferred the metro to cabs and autos for late-evening travel. between 2016 and 2020, metro ridership doubled; and after delhi introduced free bus travel for women in 2019, the numbers swelled by a million a day. yet in one recent study, women [ranked](https://share.google/xlttw2hvombdbhxrn) autos nearly equal with buses and metro in terms of availability.)

an interesting finding in the 2016 study was that more women saw sexual remarks about their appearances as just as serious as physical acts like being poked with a penis or being patted on the buttocks. both are familiar risks in the tightly packed spaces of buses and metros.

auto-rickshaws, in contrast, present a different risk profile, because there is no way to measure risk in the same terms.

women have had to adapt to these unsafe conditions, dr. disari roy told me recently. beyond using mobile phones strategically, she described how women sit in certain ways in autos. one might choose the front seat if she feels uneasy with the passengers in the back. the driver, romit chowdhury observed in his book, would shift his posture away in response.

yet, as one woman put it, there’s the fear of “how he moves his hand,” which makes many avoid the seat beside the driver.

**a few days** after she was harassed, s posted a rant before logging off her account.

the post was made up of short, broken sentences, stacked one after another — almost like free verse. occasionally, she slipped hindi into her thoughts, trying to sound casual.

one part stopped me as i tried to process the words. she wrote: “everything is just messed up, and idk how to go about it…”

“can’t i end it? all.” she asked. ◼"

indora has history indora has people who work hard every single day farmers who keep food on the tables of the nation but nobody will ever write about them nobody in the media ever comes here no influencer will ever make a video about indora because it does not fit into the aesthetic of snow covered mountains and luxury cafes what we have here is the real himachal plains rivers forests and people but none of it counts because it cannot be monetized

we are not asking for attention for vanity we are asking because being invisible means we get left behind in development too roads are bad electricity goes out all the time opportunities for the youth are so limited that everyone just wants to run away to chandigarh or delhi there is talent here there are young people with ambition but the system has decided that places like indora are not worth investing in

and it hurts because when outsiders talk about india they only celebrate the big cities and a few tourist districts the truth is that the soul of this country is in the small towns and villages that nobody talks about places like indora hold the culture the traditions the hard work that actually keep india running yet we are invisible to our own nation

i am proud of being from indora but i am angry too because our stories deserve to be told our name deserves to be known our struggles deserve to be recognized but until that happens indora will remain another forgotten corner of india and that silence says everything about who we choose to value and who we choose to ignore"
reddit,2025-09-14 16:38:16,"legal idea needed for current limbo i had given my parking space in my apartment building to someone for parking , it's was mentioned that

"" the licensee agrees that the licensor is not liable for any damage, theft or any other loss to his vehicle during the period the vehicle is parked on the said open parking space. ""

after a year or so the persons wife was paying the fees and she bought a new car an keeping that, i communicated on call to her for renewal since she was very polite and said that written is not needed and i will vacate when you say and from reference also they seem very good people so i didn't renew in writing.

on 2023 there was a scratch on her car she said that this is an arson by someone who is jealous of her car.
i said the usual thing that i am sorry for your loss and you could also take away your car to more secure space if needed, but she insisted that i let her keep the car.

 on january this year i got a query for a higher paying customer, and i communicated her that i have an offer of high paying party, she said i cannot match that offer and will have to keep my car elsewhere if i force her to increase.

( my biggest mistake) i thought since she was very polite and timely in payments i told her forget it and your could increase when you can...then she whatsapp me an audio message that it felt like talking to my brother so i am increasing the fees a bit.

now the limbo part comes 
today she called me to show me something i go there and see her car window was broken insides vandalised and music system and petrol is stolen. she told that you had no idea this was happening ( my appartment have no security guard or cctv or anything and i live on the top floor) she seemed angry but i co-operated to the best i can .

then i get a video call she was in the local police station and the officer told me to come , i went there  then the officer started asking me these questions 

- are you getting paid timely
- do you have no responsibility in  her cars security
- why don't you have cctv and such type questions 

i took it as a shock and immediately fired back that the original agreement was with her husband in which it was stated that liability of car is of owner, then i also quoted the previous scratch episode where i offered her and electric connection for a cctv.
an then she throwed barbs ( bhaichara khatam )and i said in all these months if there was insecurity in your view have you communicated these to me or you could have not kept your car here i didnt force you..she was more angry . 
then we both left the station and her relative kept bragging that she was so generous since the inspector offered to file a case against me and for damages but she said to not file a case against me....i told her thank you but you frame this one on me then she sped off.

i left her a message to call when free she immediately called and was shouting i asked about her future course of action with regards to my parking space since she has high hopes of security which i can't provide if anything happens in coming days as she took the car but kept her scooty , she screamed that i will not use your parking from the next month and since she has 15 days left she will and then she threatened me that she will go to ps again and file a fresh case against me for theft and damages as she knows people in high places , i said kindly talk politely and do what you want but kindly vacate my parking space from the start of next month.


now my question to fellow legal redditors is , am i in any kind of legal trouble i think i am not , but right now confused.....thank you"

me: 29yo, swiss, blond hair with blue eyes, traveling alone

i got insulted and scammed right away when i exited the airport, took one of those ""official"" pre paid taxi, of course the only official thing was the name.

taxi driver was probably mentally unstable, insulting everyone around including myself. happy i arrived at my hotel after he took the wrong road 5x.

i felt there is pretty much 2x types of people in delhi, the ones that hated me straight forward and wanted to scam me, and geniously nice people that were curious/nice.

i spent 3weeks in india and i did what i had to do, but i wouldn't go back for a vacation. i was surprised by the amount of nice and educated people you could randomly meet, but on the other hand there are so many scammers, everything is just over complicated and never works as intended.

i hope that all the people with good intentions will manage to balance some of the darkness that comes out from other people.

it was my 2nd trip in india and i actually learned a lot and brought a lot of memories back home, but it's just too exhausting to travel.

i wish i was not always a target for scams, i feel like i am pretty street smart with a lot of travel experience, but i couldn't imagine recommending to my mom or my sister to travel there.

even the staff that i met from dna labs that was supposed to collect some blood, started to try to scam me, wanted me to pay 60k indian rupees straight to them, i nicely refused but they would push and not hesitate to lie to get what they want.

when i signaled that to dna labs it just went to air, they said i shouldn't pay them but that's it. the problem in itself will never be solved. 
that's what is different with other countries, in other countries people would have consequences for bad behaviors, here it was like everything is just widely accepted.

i explained another scam in another thread, where the taxi driver after 6hours would dump me in a random city pretending the road is close and i should pay a night in a hotel where he would take a huge cut.


it is, what it is. i feel sorry for all the nice indian people, i made some really good friends.
if i would go back one day i'll probably only stay in closed environments, having the hotel to pick me up etc.

but i am not interested in having people trying to scam me out all day long lmao

reddit,2025-09-18 13:23:15,"factors that are making city traffic worse stress of driving is increasing day by day even when you are not driving on busy roads. people are driving on the wrong side of the road to avoid 100 meters of extra driving. as soon as they hit the road, gaming(panic) mode activated. i drive 20 kms daily from work to office and back ( i guess i am blessed). i drive mostly on less congested roads. there was a time when it used to take less than 10 mins one way. nowadays my commute time has increased to 30 mins oneway and it is still not too bad considering what people face everyday. few factors that i feel are contributing to slower traffic on road with lighter traffic: 

1. 10-min delivery drivers: they drive in every direction without looking at their sides. if they think it can save them 2 secs, they would not mind driving over the road dividers. i feel 10 mins delivery companies are creating more traffic stress in people's life than convenience. 

2. shared autos/e-rickshaws: these people are always rushed. they do not like put their feet on the brake pedal. they play gta in real life without caring about the lives of their passenger, pedestrians, two wheelers, and cyclists. they do not hesitate to get into fights and are always stressed and agitated. suppose someday policy decide to take action against us we will go strike.

3. app-based taxis: condition of their cars speaks about the driving skills. they love bumper to bumper driving even on empty roads. when they feel they miss their turn it's time time to stop the car in the middle of the road and turn back. 

4. bike taxis/porters/two wheeler riders: most skilful stunt drivers, they dodge speed breakers, pedestrians on footpaths, always find a way to reach to the front of a traffic signal at the cost of scratching few cars (no problem we are ready to fight). if you speak against us, our mla will come to our rescue as we brought him to power. 

5. police barriers during peak hours: police put barriers to check the traffic offences, catch the criminals or to divert the traffic. the only problem is that they forgot to man the barriers. after putting the barriers they get too tires and goes back to sleep somewhere. 

6. construction materiel on the road: municipal authorities is still thinking about repairing a road  but the contractor knows it so he dumps tons of material on the road and it lies there for months. i have a building material business, i shouldn't be bothered about renting or buying a warehouse to store. i can simply dump on the road and put my chair beside it and the business is ready. 

7. patting zoo for kids: kids enjoy patting animals therefore we have made our road patting zoos. in our zoos, we have cows, goats, sheeps, donkeys, dogs and buffalos. 

8. mob behaviour: we jump red lights in such large numbers that it becomes very difficult for traffic policy to fine us. when one side of the traffic is blocked, we use the other side to ensure it is also blocked. if i am not going you are not going brother, we are all stuck here."

reddit,2025-09-19 20:41:23,"hosa road of south east bangalore is one strong contender for the worst road in city so today i had to visit a place close to the pes university near electronic city, which closes by 7:30pm. we left on scooter at 6:20 from our place near hosa road, total 4.7km distance. simple right?

for the people who don't know, this hosa road is an important link between hosur road to sarjapur road. i don't have data, but there must be at least 50 thosand apartment units (plus all kind of residences) within 1 km of this road.

unfortunately, most of it is pothole ridden throughout the year. you can imagine what happened when there was a small downpour on this friday evening.

despite being on a scooter it took us &gt;45min to cover the first 2km. everyone desperate -- from pedestrians to truck drivers. everyone hopeless. saw a bmw hit a taxi from behind, one activa toppling in a narrow gap b/w a car and a large pothole. this is when we knew that there was no way we could make it by 7:30, and decided to turn back. guess what, another 40 minutes to get back home!

totally 1.5 hrs for 4km. for no reason. spoilt the evening. totally pissed.

i can only imagine what will happen when another 10-15k desperate cars will be added to bangalore roads in the next 2 months, thanks to the gst cuts."

reddit,2025-09-20 21:58:17,"how can bengaluru’s traffic mess actually be solved? bengaluru’s traffic is basically a meme at this point. but if you break it down, the problem isn’t just bad roads—it’s a mix of explosive growth, terrible planning, and zero enforcement. there’s no silver bullet, but here’s a practical layered approach:

1. immediate fixes (1–3 years)
	•	ai-based traffic signal sync → smart signals that adapt to traffic, not fixed timers.
	•	lane discipline enforcement → dedicated bus lanes, camera-based fines for cutting lanes.
	•	ban roadside parking on arterial roads → build multi-level parking hubs + last-mile shuttles.
	•	staggered office timings for it parks so everyone’s not on the road at 9 am.
	•	carpool/shuttle incentives (priority lanes, lower tolls).

2. medium-term (3–7 years)
	•	metro completion + integration → speed up purple/green extensions + airport link. single ticketing with buses.
	•	expand bmtc bus lane network (like the one on outer ring road).
	•	suburban rail push → whitefield, electronic city, yelahanka, kengeri properly connected.
	•	park-and-ride hubs at metro/bus terminals.

3. long-term (7–15 years)
	•	satellite towns → incentivize companies to move to mysuru, tumakuru, hosur. spread out jobs.
	•	ring expressways + freight bypasses → keep trucks out of the city core.
	•	zoning reform → housing + offices + retail in one area so commutes shrink.
	•	future-proofing → shared ev shuttles, autonomous pods on fixed routes.

⸻

4. cultural + tech shifts
	•	remote/hybrid work → even 20% permanent wfh would massively reduce congestion.
	•	mobility-as-a-service app → one app for metro, bus, auto, bike-taxi with single ticketing.
	•	crowdsourced traffic data integrated with city systems (like waze but official).

👉 tl;dr:
	•	quick fix: smarter signals + enforcement.
	•	medium fix: metro + bus backbone.
	•	permanent fix: urban planning + satellite towns.

reddit,2025-09-21 12:23:13,"ola electric is risking riders’ safety – scooter randomly stops, service system is a nightmare i want to share my frustrating and unsafe experience with ola electric so others can avoid this mess.

for the past 3 months, my ola scooter has had serious issues:

if battery goes below 15%, it instantly drops to 0% and shuts down. once i was stranded on the highway and had to hire a tempo to get the scooter home.

recently, i keep getting “restart your scooter” messages while riding. the scooter suddenly stops midway. this is extremely dangerous — what if a bus or truck is right behind me?

now here’s the bigger nightmare: ola service and support are broken.

the app doesn’t even have an option to book a service appointment.
	
i had to call ola customer care — and it takes 30–40 minutes just to connect. most of the time, the call gets disconnected before anyone answers.

when i visited the nearest service center (adajan, surat branch) multiple times, the staff spoke rudely. they just said: “you have to book an appointment.” i told them the app doesn’t allow it, and they told me to call support instead.

after finally waiting ~30 minutes on call, one support agent said “we can’t book appointments, but i’ll raise a ticket to the backend team.” i gave my pincode (395005, surat)… and they still booked my appointment for bhavnagar, which is ~1000 km away!

so at this point:
- my scooter is unsafe to drive.
- there’s no working way to book service in surat.
- both service center staff and customer support are rude and unhelpful.
- even after giving correct details, appointments are assigned to random faraway cities.

⚠️ if you are thinking about buying ola, please think twice. the scooter may look fancy, but if you face issues, you’re left stranded with no real support. safety is being ignored."

reddit,2025-09-25 14:14:32,"the reason behind dire state of bengaluru is lack of local governance. the last bbmp elections were way back in 2015 for 198 wards. in 2020, elections didn’t happen because of covid. now it’s been 10 years — the city has grown like crazy, but civil works have completely stalled thanks to the lack of local representation.

bengaluru’s population in 2015 was around 10.1m, and by 2025 it’s about 14.5m. that’s massive growth, but the infrastructure hasn’t kept up. what’s worse is that smaller towns like mine in chikkamagaluru actually have better roads, even with heavy rainfall, simply because local authorities are held accountable there.

this is exactly why the karnataka govt needs to fast-track the bbmp elections. without corporators and municipalities taking charge, mlas can’t do much — it’s not even in their jurisdiction. no matter what dkshi tries, without elected local reps, civic works will keep getting ignored."

men calling me an “attention seeker” and a whore. men demanding hookups or asking to “meet.” one even decided i must be a gold digger who only likes rich boys because “they can cover my expenses.” absolute garbage. and of course, these creeps don’t disappear - they keep lurking, commenting, posting, like parasites.

and instead of accountability, what’s the advice i get? just ignore it, close your dms, post less, stay in your limits. even educated men repeat this like it’s wisdom, when really it’s just cowardice. someone even suggested i should pretend to be a man online to avoid this hassle. do you hear how ridiculous that is? instead of telling men to stop being harassers, i’m supposed to erase my identity just to exist in peace?

yes, i’ve closed my dms. yes, i press ignore every time. but why is the burden always on women to shrink, hide, or change ourselves, while men roam around unchecked, harassing like it’s their birthright?

and it’s not just dms. recently, a guy even twisted a casual conversation about songs into me “liking him.” when i didn’t play along, he called me toxic. like… when the hell did that even happen? 🤡

this is the reality: women say “my presence is not an invitation,” and instead of respecting that, men double down. and society still tells us to adapt.

existing as a woman is not an open invitation. my life, my words, my posts are not an invitation . men need to get it through their thick skulls, the problem isn’t women existing, the problem is men who can’t handle a “no” without turning into creeps."

ola sells these scooters with fancy marketing hype about “revolutionizing mobility,” but after purchase, getting support is nearly impossible.

there is no proper after-sales network, spare parts are scarce, and customer service treats you like you’re bothering them. customers are left stranded with broken scooters, waiting endlessly for basic maintenance or repairs. this isn’t just bad business; it’s reckless and irresponsible. the company takes advantage of government subsidies and expansion hype while failing miserably to service the very products they sell.

for those who want specifics, here’s the list of cities in gujarat where ola’s service centers are essentially useless: ahmedabad, surat, vadodara, jamnagar, gandhinagar, nadiad, surendranagar, bharuch, vapi, veraval, porbandar, godhra, bhuj, anand, gandhidham, palanpur, valsad, navsari, botad, amreli, dwarka, ankleshwar, kalol, dahod, rajpipla, mahuva, modasa, himmatnagar, idar, vyara, wadhwan, una, palitana, mandvi, thangadh, viramgam, lunawada, khambhat, daman, diu, mangrol, babra, kadi, visnagar, mansa, petlad, kapadvanj, wadi, padra, dabhoi, savli, kheda, tarapur, karjan, dholka, dhandhuka, limbdi, dhrangadhra, chotila, dasada, halvad, lakhtar, rapar, bhachau, nakhatrana, mundra, adipur, anjar, bhimasar, dhrol, kalyanpur, okha, khambhalia, sikka, jamkhambhaliya, lalpur, bhanvad, ranavav, kutiyana, miyani, sutrapada, kodinar, talala, visavadar, maliya, vanthali, manavadar, kunkavav, bhesan, gadhada, dhola, savarkundla, bagasra, lathi, liliya, khambha, rajula, jafrabad, talaja, mahuva, gariadhar, songadh, uchchhal, malegaon, bardoli, mandvi, kamrej, olpad, mangrol, umarpada, valod, nizar, chikhli, vansda, dharampur, pardi, umbergaon, kaprada.

this is a nightmare for anyone who has bought or is considering buying an ola scooter. fancy ads and government subsidies cannot make up for a company that cannot even service its own products. if you’re thinking of buying one, stop right now. save your money and sanity, and go with a brand that actually supports its customers."

they actually took the food. i keep thinking maybe they forced him to tell them my details. he told me he didn’t, but i can’t stop worrying.

some additional clarifications to help you give good estimates:

* by “per day” i mean a full working day (say \~6–8 hours of interpreting)
* the technical nature (engineering + automotive / electronics) makes the role more specialized

fix potholes and improve roads. it's embarrassing that the so-called “it capital of india” feels like an off-road adventure the moment it rains.

autos should run on meter. tired of paying ""app-based fares"" without an app. simple enforcement can solve daily harassment for lakhs of commuters.

encourage carpooling apps and last-mile solutions (bike taxis, shared autos). these are practical, cost-effective, and eco-friendly – just support them, don’t ban them.

policing must focus on crime prevention and community trust. friendly police and  safer neighborhoods… we shouldn't fear reporting issues.

dedicated ambulance lanes. traffic jams should not decide someone’s life or death.

and let’s add a few more:
public toilets, proper garbage disposal, and stricter noise pollution checks. (ever heard an illegal loudspeaker at 2 am? we all have.)

green cover protection. stop cutting trees like they’re obstacles instead of what keeps this city livable.

please, stop adding to the chaos and fix what we already have.what do you guys think? what’s the one change you’d want to see tomorrow that would instantly improve life in this city?"

while politicians argue about whether potholes were really the cause, one thing is clear: our roads are putting lives at risk every single day. the deputy cm says there will be no congestion tax, but promises new infra projects and ₹124.5 crore for footpaths and traffic revamp. but can money and promises really fix what's broken? or is this just a temporary band-aid on a much deeper wound?



how have bangalore's road issues affected you? do you think the new projects will make a difference, or is this just another cycle of empty promises?"

everyone knows people can slip on banana peel jf we throw it on road, yet they do it,,,,,no literal civic sense 

few days back, i went with my friends for a walk, we had some chips and cold drinks, while walking on the road, one of my friend threw it on road, i kept the wrapper and empty bottle and told my friend to pick it up and go back to the hostel and throw it in dustbin there, 4/5 friends laughed at me (we sre in btech first year) 
the 4/5 friends are from bihar, i'm not pointing the particular state, i'm from bihar myself but people from village /rural side are the ones who litter the most garbage on road

i live in hostel, for our meal, sometimes we have to stand in queue, i always standed in queue with 10-15 other people, meanwhile some guys just break the queue to take the meal, are we just fools to stand in the queue??? 
my roommate also broke a queue, i told him he doesnt have civic sense and he should feel sorry for it, the guy standing before me, said he also broke the queue, the both laughed at me......the basic responsibility of a human should be to not disturb another human, it's basic sense
yet this country always fails in those cases

when i took my mom to the hospital (aiims delhi - by far the best hospital in country), the management there is so shitty that counter 3 told me to go to counter 6, the said go to counter 8, the said go to room 10 for xray, and they said go to counter 3 again to get written xray by the physician,

even to get the film of xray, i had to go to room 10 4-5 times

also, the amazing part, the visitors of few patient threw cold coffee cans in the room and biscuits wrappers, they had a bag, could have just carried it until they find a dustbin (the dustbin was just outside the room)

reddit,2025-10-02 16:39:34,"today i reached my breaking point, india is not what it was for as long as i can remember i always loved my country as i didn't have a lot of things to think about. i grew up in an orphanage till i was 5 then got adopted by a foster family. for some reason things didn't work out and i was adopted by another foster family when i was 8.

since then i've come a long way, that feeling of patriotism always stayed with me throughout my career, i wanted to do something for my country, something i would be good at and interested in, i graduated as a mechanical engineer and chose to work under a private company under a government military enginnering services contract.
i thought it would be a decent job (at least the pay was decent)  - instead it was fuck ton full of corruption, shit work times and even worse work ethics. i quit that job 2 years ago and since then i have been working in a fully private company that actually cared about employees (weirdest pattern is that foreign companies behave like this but not indian ones). i thought that was the only bad part about my country, i was so fkn wrong.

for context my foster father used to work in a government college, by caste the entire family's obc and did struggle financially, but being a government servant made it so that he can't use any benefits of the obc category. i was like ok that's not a big issue. fast forward to today everywhere i go my surname is associated with that cast and at institutions where i am supposed to mention my caste everytime people look at me like i'm fucking crazy, these morons think that i am disrespecting my caste. my younger brother who was taking an admission in a college got shit from the admission officer and bystanders for saying that's he's going the general route despite his surname being associated with an obc caste. like seriously wtf is this obsession with castes and surnames?

i'd like to add an incident that happened today, i was waiting at a traffic signal in my car along with my family, i was already in a slightly agitated mood and then a few hijras arrived demanding money. one of them banged on my car and started pulling the handles, and then almost 6-7 of them surrounded my car like i owed money to them??, if they would've asked politely or sold somthing (bags, flowers, anything) i would've given 100-200rs, but straight up trying to unlock a car? tf are their brains at? 
worst part about is this my family started persuading me to *give them something in the name of god*, *as i need their blessings to succeed*, this triggered me more than anything so i child locked all windows and said i'm not giving anything - it's my car my choice, parents got furious. even after the green signal these shitheads wouldn't move so i started moving the car, they got a bit scared but wouldn't back off so i accelarated and then my mirror hit one of them, that's when my family started cursing me. call me crazy, call me hot-tempered, i don't care, i value my car.

it's like i could tolerate till a certain extent but this is beyond that. what i'm trying to say is i keep finding ways to love the country i was born in and trying very hard to not regret staying here.

everywhere i go i face this shit, top that off with shitty drivers, shitty roads, shitty electricity,even shittier people (not all but the general population). i pay my taxes like a donkey and work my ass off to get literally nothing. today was my breaking point hence the realisation.

today i realised that the country i was born in no longer exists, or perhaps it never existed, maybe my imagination was skewed.

reddit,2025-10-02 17:46:20,"my thoughts after visiting a foreign country recently i have lived in usa and dubai before this, and while i did feel the difference between those places and india, it never affected me much, because well 
usa is the richest country on earth and dubai is rich from oil. but recently i travelled to a couple of asian countries and it gave me a jolt, as to how far behind we are. 

i recently visited malaysia and singapore. out of this, singapore is classified as a developed country based on all criteria used by international organizations, it is also similar to dubai and usa for the high cost of living. 

but malaysia - although it meets only 2/3 of the criteria to be a developed country, it feels like it has met all criteria. 
inspite of the lower size of economy ($1.47 trillion compared to 14 trillion of india - ppp gdp), their per capita gni is $14,700 which classifies it as a high-income country. 
it is also the only asean country to have met ""very high human development"" status. 

india per capita gni is $2,540 which means two things - our wealth is extremely concentrated among a small number of people. we need to increase our per capita income 6x times before we can call ourselves a developed country. 

100% of south asian countries were classified as low-income countries in 1987, whereas this share has fallen to just 13% in 2023. which means while our neighbors were becoming developed we are stuck in a poor rut. 

while in malaysia, i felt like i was in an alternate india, which has somehow become developed nation in another universe. they were under colonial rule till around the same time we became independent.

49% of people used to be in poverty. in about two decades, they brought down that number to 17%, without fudging with the statistics. today, less than 1 percent of people are poor there. 

every place i went was clean, even a roadside public toilet. 

no honking on the roads, which were without potholes. people waiting calmly in queues and signals. petrol costs around 50 rupees. that too without any ethanol. 

and the country was low on living costs. i looked at real estate prices and they were surprisingly affordable compared to india. 

a prime minister was caught for corruption, he was convicted by the court and is in jail now. he was fined $10 million and police confiscated his assets worth hundreds of millions. we can't even imagine such a thing happening in india. our governments are filled with convicts and criminals on all sides. 

i kept wondering, is such a future possible for india? we seem to be a country where everybody is on their own. education, healthcare, retirement support, and everything have to be paid by the individual with not much support from the government. after paying the taxes, i have to save and pay for all these myself. there is no wonder we have civic sense failures - we are all in survival mode all the time. 

especially after covid, the income has stagnated, and the gap between the rich and poor has widened. economy is said to be going in a k shape, with the poor becoming poorer and rich becoming richer. 

would we have done better if we went with an eu-style union of states? 

did we commit a stupidity by going for a non-alignment stand in our formative years?

is there a chance india can develop to the level of these countries?"

at this point, i’m convinced bbmp is running a **“dig 10 times, get 1 free”** scheme. the road is basically a subscription service — you never *own* it, you’re just renting smooth asphalt for a few days before it gets recycled.

reddit,2025-10-04 00:13:00,"""casual violence"" was watching arundhati roy's conversation with mehdi , centered around comparison between zionism and hindutva.

around the 30 minute mark roy spoke about the increase of ""casual violence"" akin to situations of mindless agression/rage that leads to harm to life. 

eg: person did not like that someone else parked their car in a particular spot so 1 killed 2. (you know this kind of acts exist. they are real. and they are increasing).

also increasing is the amount of insensitivity and apathy amongst people. there are so many reasons for it. politics  the 9pm news that feeds you false propaganda creates more rage and frustration, the actual problems- oil, gas, electricity, infra etc that no one pays attention to. competition,  paper leaks, the fact that the govt will rather spend money on cricket matches than honour victims of terrorism;  jail actual national heroes. so much more. 

in all this chaos, it is us the people who just want to live daily lives, are exhausted by work, by our economy,  our families that suffer the most. 

roy rightly said india has changed, it no longer ger feels like the home, the pride i carried as a child. it feels dirty not just from the blatant lack of civic sense but from these corrupt politicians and elites that have manufactured spectacularly a population of exhausted slaves that cannot and dare not care anymore. and then a few dogs that run on their command to keep those slaves docile.

what has been done to mr. wangchuk is a shameful blot on our democracy,  our constitution and our fundamental rights are citizens of india. yesterday it was manipur today it is ladakh. tomorrow it can be anyone's home town. it could be anyone you know.

i graduated with a civil engineering degree in 2015. my first job was as a trainee for a year, but i had to quit because of depression and other personal issues. the team was in some remote area, and it was soul-crushing—no intellectual conversations, just people slogging through work. no sundays off, not even on republic day. skip a day, and they’d cut your attendance. brutal.

then i joined a highway contractor for nhai projects, working my butt off in the quality department. i handled tests for subgrade, gsb, wmm, dbm, bc—everything. checked clay, cement, bitumen, binding materials, managed documentation, and ran around on-site. but the work conditions? absolute garbage. you’re stuck in some rural “dehaat” with no civilization, no society, nowhere to even spend your money. even the auto drivers had more civility than the people i worked with. drivers and machine operators? mostly uneducated, desperate folks acting like brainwashed zombies with no manners.

i got so fed up that i tried switching careers. spent a couple of years learning programming—django, python, the whole deal—hoping to land a job at a tier 1 it company. got an internship at an insurance aggregator, only to get kicked out when the company merged. just my luck.

so, i had to crawl back to civil engineering. i thought building projects might be better than highways. maybe they’d give us sundays off? nope. instead of 12-hour shifts, 7 days a week, these are *14-hour shifts, 7 days a week*. no breaks, no life.

and don’t get me started on the family pressure. my parents are like, “we told you so!” yeah, i get it, i’m a burden. they wanted me to get a stable job so i could live comfortably, but this is india. there are *no labor rights*, *no employment rights*, nothing. politicians and ceos push for construction to be done faster and cheaper, while hr and management types are busy skimming profits—selling everything from food to diesel to line their pockets. no proper nutrition, no hygiene, and these people act like they’re winners just for surviving this mess.

i’m done with the construction industry. common people complain about bad roads and buildings, blaming engineers like us. trust me, it’s not our fault. we’re just trying to survive. we don’t need huge salaries—just a sunday off, a few hours to sleep, and a chance to have a personal life. is that too much to ask?

reddit,2025-10-07 19:24:48,"what if every indian panchayat had its own official social media page? imagine every panchayat in india had verified pages on instagram, facebook and x, and any resident could post a photo or short video of a local issue and tag the official account for action.  
if a road is broken, a drain is clogged or garbage is piling up, a tagged post becomes a public nudge that is visible to everyone in the area, not just a private complaint that disappears into a call center.

# why this can work

cities like gurugram already route whatsapp, x, facebook and instagram posts into a complaint system that assigns and escalates issues to departments, so the tech and process are not science fiction.  
panchayats also have national digital backbones like egramswaraj that track plans, budgets and assets, which could be linked so a social post becomes a ticket with status and deadlines.

# what a clean flow looks like

a post with a tag generates a ticket id automatically, the system acknowledges it, forwards it to the right team and shows status like received, assigned and resolved in a public dashboard.  
if a ticket is closed without a fix, the complainant can reopen or escalate, using standard grievance rules and local help desks to keep pressure on action rather than pr.

# will politicians allow it

top down policy pushes for digital governance and transparency at the gram panchayat level suggest there is room for this, especially if it plugs into existing platforms rather than creating another app no one maintains.  
but local power dynamics matter and page control, moderation and contractor selection can become gatekeeping points unless the process is codified and audited.

# the obvious risks

official pages can turn into showcase feeds with low follow through if there are no service levels, no escalation and no public reports by ward or department.  
new “page maintenance” contracts can become rent seeking if budgets and kpis are not tied to ticket resolution metrics that anyone can verify.

# simple guardrails to try

make every tagged post a ticket with an id, clock and sla, visible on a public dashboard tied to the panchayat code, so closure claims are checkable by residents and media.  
publish weekly stats by category and location and auto escalate overdue items to block and district officers to avoid silent closures and dead ends.

# what about reach and inclusion

most villages now have some form of internet access and panchayat systems already run on national stacks, so the missing piece is staff training and simple workflows, not raw connectivity alone.  
use whatsapp for intake, keep posts bilingual, and add a call back option so people who cannot compose posts still get tickets created and tracked.

# a quick real world snapshot

gurugram’s authority accepts whatsapp messages with photos and also tracks issues raised on x, facebook and instagram inside its grievance software so they do not vanish in a thread.  
that same idea can scale to rural bodies if ticketing is tied to panchayat profiles in egramswaraj, which already integrates planning, accounting and asset directories with unique codes.

# open questions to the community

1. would elected members support a system where every public tag becomes a timed, visible ticket, or would there be pushback over losing message control ?

  
2. if cities already integrate social media into grievance handling, what stands in the way of a template rollout for panchayats linked to the national portal and codes ?

  
3. how should moderation be handled so genuine posts are not buried, while spam and abuse are filtered without political bias, and what is the right appeal path when a post is taken down ?

  
4. what training, language support and offline options are needed so older residents and low connectivity areas can still create and track tickets without being left out ?"

my biggest mistake was not reading the google reviews , even though it shows 4.5 stars , always the first review is 1 star review speaking of how they have been treated and  scammed by colive. when i was joining the pg they forced me to give a 5 star with a description saying how good it is. this has been by far the worst experience in my life from a pg. i have luckily recorded a few of incidents just in case i have to use it against them someday. but this place is a literal nightmare, i’m writing this post soo that no one joins this scam of a pg. the moral is - don’t ever sign up for anything related to colive cuz everyone has been scammed one way or another.

this country was once famous for smart people and good ideas, but now it feels dirty, actually dirty, and messed up in other ways too. every street and every river, almost any famous place looks like a garbage pile. tourists come and laugh at us. india used to be a spot for people looking for peace and culture, to learn something new. these days, it's scams, trash, noise, and just confusion.

the world used to respect us for being hard-working and kind and spiritual. now it seems like everyone's into shortcuts and cheating. we used to care about spiritual stuff now lots of hate everywhere. be a religion or language . we used to be together. now everyone is fighting over silly and stupid problems like language and religion and political opinions, and and age old issues of ex indian monarchs that should've been forgotten long back.

and the younger folks instead of changing any of this are stuck in easy money apps, cheap timepass, and fake hero stuff. barely anyone cares about the future or the country, or the people living here. watching reels spreading hate.

people treat politicians like they’re gods, the celebrity worship culture has gotten out of hand. we keep saying “bharat mata” but won’t even keep the place clean. we talk about women’s respect but the headlines are filled with awful news every other day.

honestly, i feel ashamed. i do. this is my home. it hurts. this isn’t the india i thought i’d grow up in. this isn’t what i hoped for.

but, at least i can try changing myself. maybe some of us can.

we could stop throwing trash anywhere.
we could wear helmets.
we could actually follow traffic rules.
we could respect women.
we could respect every religion and every person, wherever they’re from.
we could stop fighting about the past.
we could care less about religion, and more about just caring for people.

past is past. what matters now is what we do today and what happens next.

even if we've got fancier tech and better roads, honestly it feels like we’re behind by decades. we’re kind of screwed up as a society. if we don’t fix that, then there’s really no point bragging about progress.

wish people could just feel this, just pause for a second and admit we’re messing up. and we’re probably the only ones who can fix it.

meanwhile, i look at china and other countries and i see them progressing with the manpower they had. we also should have been performing like that, but we are not. the youth of the country has been polarized and is blind of the real issues and has forgotten. who’s the real enemy 


we have become a dogmatic society who will follow political ideology of their favorite film star. we should do something before we become a global joke. starting now, each of us should at least behave in public while going out should read more read more about civilized societies. read books engage in good discussions respectful do not hate woman for being women and  having an opinion. should be a better human and not eve tease  woman who are out in the public we should strive for more.


we should do better"
reddit,2025-10-10 03:28:45,"argued over throwing garbage on the road **tl;dr:** saw someone throw garbage, confronted him, argued for 15 minutes, and now i’m overthinking whether it was even worth it, was i being a prick or that was the right thing to do.

so this happened on the evening of **9th oct**. i was walking back home after picking up laundry from my local laundromat when i saw this guy step out of a shop and casually throw a cardboard box on the road.

i was honestly baffled. walked a few steps, reached his shop, and said:  
“yaake guru, yaake illi kasa esuttidira?”  
(“why man, why are you throwing garbage here?”)

he turned around and said, “kya hua?”  
so i replied, “aap kachra kyun phenkte ho road pe?”

he came out, and we started arguing.

**me:** yeh sab mat karo, chhota dustbin rakh lo. main yahan rehta hoon, gandagi mat failao.  
**him:** main bhi yahin rehta hoon.  
**me:** kaunsa cross? (i knew he was lying.)  
**him:** yahin pe.  
**me:** kahan? my neighborhood? domlur? indiranagar? ulsoor? kidhar rehte ho?  
**him:** ruk, location deta hoon.  
**me:** yaar, aapke ghar pe koi kachra daale toh acha lagega kya? mat dala karo road pe.

he shrugged and said, *“ab phenk diya toh phenk diya.”* then came the excuses:

* everyone throws garbage, why single me out?
* the food stall ahead also throws.
* daily wagers eat gutka and litter.
* trees shed leaves too — that’s also garbage.

i told him, *“i can only correct what’s in front of me. i’m not going to run to modi ji or dk shivakumar for this. you own a medical store, you seem educated — this is your area, your road.”*

things got a bit heated. he said, *“what will you do, hit me?”*  
i said, *“why would i hit you?”*

then another older man — a kannadiga uncle — stepped in, probably his acquaintance, and said, *“karnataka dalli kannada matadi.”*  
i told him, *“heli sir, nanage kannada barutte.”*  
didn’t want to escalate it, so i said, *“okay sir, neevu hogi.”*.  
i said ""please dhyaan rakho"" and left.

in the end, i just felt like i’d wasted 15 minutes.

here’s the thing — i’m a bit obsessive about cleanliness. even with friends or cousins, i tell them not to litter. sometimes i even pick up cigarette butts myself. they used to laugh, but now they’ve stopped littering too out of shame. we just try to leave every place as we found it — because it isn't possible to clean up after others.

i’m not even originally from bangalore, but after living here so long, it feels like home. it genuinely hurts to see people just mess things up and shrug it off. sure, the government is negligent, but that doesn’t mean we stop behaving responsibly as individuals.

anyway, that’s my little rant. couldn’t sleep, so i thought i’d share.

ps: my kannada is so-so. please don't judge."

reddit,2025-10-11 14:12:59,"city trap: footpaths, frustration, and filth. 
the vicious cycle of public space: from bus driver to footpath garbage
let's trace a line of frustration: every bus driver has a problem with a car driver, who has a problem with a two-wheeler rider, who in turn has a problem with a pedestrian. and the pedestrian?
exactly. the pedestrian has an issue with the garbage on the footpath.
because the footpath is blocked, pedestrians are forced to walk on the road. now, to escape traffic, bikers start riding on the footpath. where are people supposed to walk then? it's obvious—everyone wants others to stay in their own lane, but the reality is everyone is pushing everyone else out.
it’s like everyone’s hand is in this mess. from the bus driver to the pedestrian, everyone contributes to destroying the very spaces they need. we are destroying our own footpaths by throwing garbage on them. 
this isn't just one person's problem; it's a collective failure. everyone should be contributing to keeping it clean.
the temple road example
let’s take an example right on the main road connecting to the famous banashankari temple. people visit this area because it’s a place of worship and belief. so, shouldn't people keep the area clean?
no.

you can see so much garbage piled up on the footpath. it has made the road incredibly narrow and the trash is now spilling onto the traffic lane.
walk just 50 meters, and check again. there's another designated garbage-throwing spot there. why can't people just throw everything in one place? each person seems to prefer their own specific spot. now look at this photo: the presence of existing garbage acts as a temptation. it's like a mental force: ""so much trash is already here, who cares? i'll join in."" the result is people dumping glass and all sorts of things from their vehicles.
this is causing a serious issue. since this is happening in every area, you can expect the city to turn from whatever good names it had into ""traffic city"" and soon, into a garbage place too.
the government's role
this is as much a public issue as a government one. you might say, ""how? it's the people who are at fault! how can the government fix people's brains?""
but check this photo: here is a public washroom, right here, but it's closed. what is the auto driver supposed to do? he is forced to relieve himself on the wall or on the road. once one person does it, others follow.
the government could easily keep it open, charge a small fee, and control it. no one would blame them for taking that action.
as much as the government has a part to play, the people must be just as responsible.

reddit,2025-10-12 11:42:07,"they call it progress. i call it extinction in the name of development — great nicobar deserves better. i’m not against development.
i’m against the kind of “development” that forgets who it’s supposed to serve.

what’s happening in great nicobar island isn’t nation-building — it’s a gamble. a ₹44,000 crore gamble with earthquakes, forests, and the lives of people who’ve lived there peacefully for centuries.

they call it a transshipment hub — a “new singapore.” but what they won’t tell you is that thousands of hectares of dense evergreen forest will be cut, that it lies in a high seismic zone, and that the shompen and nicobarese tribes — our fellow indians — will be displaced from their ancestral homes.

all this for a dream that looks glamorous on paper, but cracks under reality.

there is a better way.

we already have deep ports — vizhinjam, paradip, tuticorin, kamarajar — capable of handling massive ships with minor upgrades. strengthening these would cost less, employ more, and won’t destroy a single rainforest.

we can still secure our oceans.
build smaller naval bases powered by solar and wind, not entire cities.
construct an airport for connectivity — yes — but not an artificial singapore on a fragile island.

and while we talk about infrastructure — let’s build schools, hospitals, and communication networks there first. let the people of nicobar live better before we decide how to make the land “profitable.”

if costa rica can preserve 60% of its forests and still thrive economically, why can’t india?
why must our development always start with destruction?


we’ve seen this story before.

remember the big “masterstroke” cities?
dholera — still on paper.
amravati — never became real.
and even when they do get built, what happens next?

take atal setu — the pride of mumbai. grand budget, huge inauguration, and now within months, people complain about tolls, vibrations, lane bottlenecks, and poor maintenance.
if that’s the condition of a bridge near the financial capital, imagine what will happen to something built thousands of kilometres away, on an island prone to earthquakes and tsunamis.

we’ve seen this over and over:
build fast. spend big. forget later.

and each time, it’s the same photo-op, the same glamour, the same promise of “visionary leadership” — and the same silence when the ground starts cracking.

the truth is simple.

the great nicobar doesn’t need another singapore.
it needs sustainable connection, not commercial invasion.
it needs our protection, not our pride.

because when you destroy an island for ambition, you don’t just lose land — you lose culture, biodiversity, and the conscience of a nation.

the people who live there are not “backward” — they are the real india.
they live with nature, not over it. and it’s time we learn from them instead of displacing them.


to those who say “we need progress”

yes, we need power. yes, we need ports.
but what we don’t need is thoughtless progress — the kind that looks good on a poster but collapses under truth.

we can strengthen the mainland ports, modernize existing infrastructure, and still achieve what this project promises — without losing what makes india unique.

our rulers today love to build for cameras — massive budgets, big words, and bigger statues — but when it comes to building trust, they’re bankrupt.

if this project was truly for india’s future, it would begin with the people, not bulldozers.
it would protect forests, not feed the hunger of a few men hiding behind “national interest.”


the real development

real development isn’t when we turn every forest into concrete — it’s when every child has a school, every villager has clean water, every soldier has safety, and every tree still has a place to grow.

let’s not forget — this is our land, our ocean, our people.
if the government truly represents us, it should listen to us.
because when the last tree falls and the last tribe leaves, the port will stand tall — but the soul of india will be gone.

reddit,2025-10-12 12:09:34,"bangalore and its street dog problem – my experience last night last night i went for a casual night ride with my friends, and what happened on my way back really shook me and made me think seriously about the street dog situation in bangalore.

i stay near bellandur and was heading home around midnight. after agara, the road near iblur junction was closed because of metro construction, so i had to take a detour. i avoided the flyover reroute and turned into a narrow street near the royal enfield showroom. i was riding slowly and calmly through the lane when, out of nowhere, 3-4 street dogs started chasing me aggressively. there were at least 10-12 dogs in the area.

shocked, i instinctively tried to accelerate to get away, but thanks to bbmp and their gravel-filled roads, the sudden throttle caused my bike to lose traction. i slipped and skidded for nearly 5 meters before falling. even after that, the dogs kept coming at me.
thankfully, a few locals rushed in and chased the dogs away. i am extremely grateful i was wearing my riding gear- jacket and gloves, which saved me from bigger injuries. but since i thought it was just a short ride, i skipped knee guards and riding pants, and that was a mistake. i walked away with scraped knees, and my bike took a minor hit—a dent on the exhaust-but the metal frame saved it from major damage.

my takeaway
i love dogs, and i’ve always been kind to them, but the street dog problem in bangalore is getting serious-especially during nights in less populated areas. this isn’t just about fear; it’s about public safety. incidents like these can lead to serious injuries, accidents, and even deaths.

i genuinely feel the bbmp and local authorities need to act:- relocate aggressive street dogs to shelters outside the city- repair inner road conditions and remove loose gravel which is a huge hazard for two-wheelers- increase night patrolling and complaint hotlines for stray aggression cases

message to fellow riders
- always wear full riding protection – even if it’s a small ride
- stay alert in narrow lanes and silent areas at night

this could have been worse. i’m sharing this so others stay safe. bangalore is an amazing city-but this street dog issue is real, and we need proper action before it gets out of hand.
stay safe out there.
gear up. roads and dogs won’t spare mistakes.

reddit,2025-10-12 15:02:46,"bangalore our city is changed— roads broken, auto mafia thriving, citizens suffering i honestly feel heartbroken and angry after what i went through recently in bangalore.

i was travelling from my home to the airport for an important flight. it took me 3.5 hours to reach — 3.5 hours for 45 km! i was literally about to miss my flight. the entire stretch felt like a nightmare — potholes, chaos, jams, endless construction, and zero planning.

for those 3 hours, i was tense and helpless. what made it worse? the uber driver saw my desperation and demanded ₹2100 for a ride that showed ₹1400 when i booked. i had no choice but to pay. it felt like being looted in broad daylight.

then i travelled to delhi and pune recently — and it hit me how bad bangalore has become. the roads there were smooth, the traffic moved, and drivers were decent and humane.

in pune, i accidentally went to the wrong hotel branch and panicked because i was short on time. i approached an auto driver directly, expecting another argument — but he surprised me. he turned on the meter, charged fairly, and even offered to drop me to the airport when he realised i was rushing for a flight. no drama, no exploitation, just basic human kindness.

coming back to bangalore felt like coming back to chaos.
here, every auto driver feels like part of a money-hungry mafia. they exploit people shamelessly — doesn’t matter if it’s a man, woman, or someone in an emergency. humanity is gone.

and the roads? completely collapsed. traffic is out of control. every commute feels like punishment. and still, no accountability, no improvement, no respect for the people who pay taxes and keep this city running.

we don’t deserve this.
we are not asking for luxury — just basic infrastructure and fair treatment. why are we treated like atms by our own system? why is there no empathy from the government, the police, or the transport department?

if all of them — the government, auto unions, pwd, police, and citizens — actually cared about each other, bangalore could be heaven. but today, it feels like we’re living in a city where everyone just wants to squeeze you dry.

no bins, no choice: if there’s no trash bin on the street, where are people supposed to throw waste?

unreliable pickup: garbage trucks come at random times. people can’t skip work waiting for them.

no sunday collection: the one day people are home, no vehicle comes. the system literally discourages responsible behavior.

public silence fuels failure: we’ve normalized poor services instead of demanding accountability.

broken footpaths. garbage scattered around. loose hanging wires overhead. potholes and patches of darkness where even streetlights had given up.

most of the issues blamed on lack of civic sense, like littering, trash dumping, or urinating in the open, happen because basic facilities simply don’t exist. if there were dustbins every hundred metres, why would anyone throw trash on the street? if garbage was collected regularly, why would people dump it in open spaces? if there were clean public toilets available, why would anyone urinate in the open?

and because people have grown up seeing this around them, they’ve become psychologically conditioned to think it’s normal. when an environment repeatedly reinforces certain behaviour, the brain registers it as acceptable. people aren’t inherently careless; they have just adapted to what the system has shown them all their lives.

we blame the citizens for lack of civic sense but rarely hold municipalities accountable for not providing the infrastructure that actually makes civic behaviour possible. until that changes, shouting “have some civic sense” will remain just another buzzword people repeat for social approval.

reddit,2025-10-16 23:56:59,"regretting my life choices because this country is doomed! i couldn't help but write this post to release the pent-up frustrations for bangalore and india that has been brewing inside me for the past 2 years. this is gonna be a long rant! i am in tokyo right now, and i can't help keep my emotions to myself. it's only been 2 days and i walked for over 25 kms. and this is the thought i had - india will never be as good as these countries in a 100 years. i'm not talking about catch up, i'm talking about how india won't be as good as how these countries are right now. i'll probably get a lot of hatred for the statement, but let me explain. 

1. it's so great to walk. coming from india, it's rejuvenating to walk without interruptions. there are footpaths, well-maintained footpaths. no exposed drains. no waste. no dog shit. no bikes. the main footpaths are accessible for the disabled (wheelchairs) and the blind. i bet there's not even 1km of footpath in our country that is accessible to everyone. i see mothers cycling with their toddlers and pushing strollers. can we do it safely anywhere? can we take kids on footpaths safely in bangalore? 

2. no one honked at me. not once! well, i never heard even a single vehicle honk on the roads. the signals work. zebra crosses have pedestrian signals and they are maintained. even the smaller roads, just big enough to fit a k-car has zebra crossings marked and pedestrian signals. 

3. the roads are well maintained. there's no traffic apart from vehicles waiting at signals. no deadly potholes. i am lucky enough to be in the top 1% (in terms of earning) in india, but i am legit scared for my life while i ride my bike around. the top 1% and you are scared for your life on a daily basis! had to take my bike through balegare and brookefield in the rain last day, and my 'kinda atheist' ass was praying for my fucking life. perks of living in the 4th largest economy is that it makes you god fearing. 

4. it's so clean! so frigging clean! it's raining here and there's no mud or dirt. i can use my shoes to walk. the shoes i brought from bangalore are cleaner after walking in the streets here. and i can't put my head around that.

5. people stop the car for you. they ask you to cross the roads before they step on the pedal. in contrast, i waited for 10 mins (literally 10 mins) to cross a road in hoodi. not a single soul stopped the vehicle for me. i had to walk back and get my bike to cross the road. it's so easy and not frustrating to walk and get around. 

6. people don't cut the queue when you turn your back to them. people are not in a hurry. people are polite. i saw a lot of smiling and happy faces in public. 

7. public transport is so good. and so fast. we all have heard of japan having bullet trains. but i didn't realise how fast they are. tokyo to kyoto (450 kms) is 2 hours! that is the same as whitefield to koramangala on a wednesday!  

8. even the small things - the markings on the roads, the reflectors, the extension joints on the bridges - they are all so much better. 

9. bangalore has made me hate my country, and it's not something i am proud of. i have lived in kochi and chennai, and i can't stay silent about how dirty and broken this city is. i can't even bash the infrastructure because it literally doesn't exist. how many years should we wait for basic amenities like public waste bins? 

10. now, why do i regret the life choices? because i had a chance to work in japan, and i chose my country over this. comparable pay, and i decided to stay back. people talk about brain drain, and how new graduates should be retained. but what do we have to retain them? what do we have to give to them? i will never take such a decision. i'll leave in a heartbeat if i get another opportunity. 


well, that's all folks!

p.s: 

to people who would say that whitefield is not bangalore, i don't care. it is under the corporation and better take accountability for it. i am in the outskirts of tokyo, and well, it's not like whitefield or varthur. 

to the people blaming everything on the influx of migrants to bangalore, the government is giving permission to the companies to operate in the city. 

to the people blaming things on migrants and asking them to get out, i would gladly do it if given a chance."
reddit,2025-10-17 15:01:18,"india's bridge collapse scam: same contractors build bad roads and bridges, they fall down, and they get new jobs again edit: this is the first part of the post.

i've been researching bridge and road collapses in india over the last 5 years and discovered a disturbing pattern - it's literally a tender scam where contractors build cheap quality infrastructure, it collapses, and they get fresh contracts to rebuild or work on other projects. let me break this down.

**the scale of the problem**

between 2020-2025, india has witnessed an alarming number of bridge collapses. union minister nitin gadkari reported 55 cases of collapses or damages on nhai roads, bridges, and tunnels over five years - 40 during construction and 15 on completed projects.
 (https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/55-instances-of-collapse-damage-on-nhai-roads-bridges-tunnels-in-5yrs-gadkari-101753886591588.html)

but media reports suggest the real number is much higher - 170 collapses with 202 deaths over just four years, indicating massive underreporting. 

(https://www.newslaundry.com/2025/07/29/4-years-170-collapses-202-deaths-whats-ailing-indias-bridges) 

a 2020 study found that 2,130 bridges collapsed in india between 1977 and 2017. 

**major collapses in recent years**

gujarat's gambhira bridge in vadodara collapsed on july 9, 2025, killing 22 people when vehicles plunged into the mahi river. the 40-year-old bridge had shown structural decay for years, yet remained operational. locals reported it shook dangerously when vehicles crossed, but authorities kept it open to traffic. 

the morbi suspension bridge collapse on october 30, 2022 killed 135 people. investigation revealed broken wires, faulty welding, and improper renovation. the contractor replaced wooden planks with aluminum sheeting without proper testing. 

gujarat has witnessed 17 structural failures over five years total. 

bihar saw 12 bridges collapse within just 20 days in 2024. 

the indrayani river bridge near pune collapsed on june 15, 2025, killing four people and injuring 18. grants for replacement had been approved the previous year, but work orders were issued only after 18 months. 

**now here's where it gets really disturbing - the contractor tender game**

**ranjit buildcon - ahmedabad**

ranjit buildcon built the mumatpura flyover in ahmedabad that collapsed on december 21, 2021. auda suspended the company and proposed debarring them for three years. but here's the kicker - after floating tenders twice with no bidders, auda gave the exact same company the contract to complete the collapsed bridge. the ₹82 crore project was handed back to ranjit buildcon despite the investigation committee not even submitting its final report.

this was the third incident involving ranjit buildcon - earlier bridge projects in surat in 2007 also witnessed accidents where one person died.
 (https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/collapse-of-ahmedabad-flyover-third-incident-involving-same-company-7687752/) 

despite this track record, the company continues handling major projects for vadodara, rajkot, surat civic bodies, and the ahmedabad-gandhinagar metro rail. media reports describe ranjit buildcon as gujarat government's ""favourite contractor"".
 
**sp singla construction - bihar**

sp singla construction built the aguwani-sultanganj bridge over the ganga in bhagalpur district at a ₹1,710 crore cost. the bridge collapsed twice - first on april 30, 2022, and again on june 4, 2023. 

bihar issued a show-cause notice asking why the company shouldn't be blacklisted. but get this - sp singla construction continued operating on major projects in gujarat during this entire period.
 (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/contractor-of-collapsed-bihar-bridge-building-two-in-gujarat/articleshow/100806076.cms) 

the company had already built bridges in assam, and after the bihar collapse, assam cm ordered iit inspections of their bridges, but the company remained active.

**gpc infrastructure - palanpur**

gpc infrastructure was blacklisted by the bjp government in gujarat in 2016-17 after one-third of a road they built got washed away during monsoon in ahmedabad. despite being blacklisted, the same company got a contract in 2021 to build the palanpur bridge. that bridge collapsed on october 23, 2023, killing two people. congress leader amit chavda alleged that gpc infrastructure had contributed approximately ₹1 crore to the bjp's party fund before the 2019 election.
 (https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/palanpur-bridge-collapse-firm-blacklisted-2016-17-gujarat-congress-leader-amit-chavda-8999131/)

**oreva group - morbi**

this one is absolutely insane. the oreva group was given the morbi bridge renovation contract without any tender process at all. oreva specializes in cfl bulbs, wall clocks, and e-bikes - they had zero experience in bridge construction.

a bombay firm had bid for the contract at a lower price, but the district collector received a call to award it to oreva despite their higher quote and lack of expertise. the gujarat high court even questioned why the operation and maintenance contract was given without floating a tender.

the company claimed they did ""100% renovation in ₹2 crore"" but didn't replace old cables and opened the bridge without a fitness certificate. the bridge collapsed killing 135 people.

as congress leader amit chavda stated: ""today in gujarat, if you want to take up a contract for a road or bridge, as long as a commission is not sent to the kamlam [bjp office], the contract is not awarded.""

**why there's no real accountability**

bihar suspended 16 engineers after 12 bridges collapsed in 20 days. but the supreme court criticized the government for reinstating suspended officers after public attention shifted.
 (https://www.deccanherald.com/india/bihar/bihar-bridge-collapses-officers-suspended-then-brought-back-observes-sc-3473956)

such suspensions ""hardly act as a deterrent, as has been seen in the past. these suspensions are revoked after few weeks once media and public attention shifts."" government sources admit such committees have never led to punishment of any official or contractor in the past.
 (https://latest.sundayguardianlive.com/news/bridge-collapse-in-bihar-exposes-commission-system)

companies simply change names to bypass blacklisting. s n bhobe &amp; associates was blacklisted by surat municipal corporation after a flyover collapse, but within a month, the firm was demerged into tpf engineering private limited with the same directors. tpf then won six mumbai contracts.
 (https://indianexpress.com/article/india/under-new-name-firm-blacklisted-in-surat-won-six-mumbai-contracts-5739402/)

despite 55 cases of collapses on nhai roads, bridges, and tunnels, only two incidents resulted in disciplinary action - one project director was suspended and another transferred. that's it.

the morbi case with 135 deaths remains without charges filed two years later. 

**the mumatpura case reveals the mechanism**

when auda floated tenders twice after the mumatpura collapse, no bidders came forward because tender conditions required the new bidder to take responsibility for the entire bridge while only completing remaining construction. this makes re-awarding to the original contractor the ""easy"" option for officials.
 (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/barred-firm-to-complete-collapsed-flyover/articleshow/95870630.cms)

additionally, contractors maintain political connections through donations and commissions that protect them from blacklisting. this creates a vicious cycle: corrupt tender awards → substandard construction due to commission system → collapse → same contractors get rebuild contracts → repeat.

**what happens after collapses**

compensation is announced but often not fully paid. after the gambhira bridge collapse, gujarat cm announced ₹4 lakh compensation for each deceased and ₹50,000 for the injured.
 (https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gujarat-bridge-collapse-gambhira-bridge-vehicles-fell-one-after-another-fisherman-on-moments-after-bridge-broke-8848187)

for morbi, the gujarat high court ordered oreva to pay ₹10 lakh interim compensation to each deceased's family and ₹2 lakh to the injured, but the company struggled to pay even 50% of the interim amount.
 (https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/deposited-50-of-interim-compensation-for-morbi-bridge-victims-oreva-in-hc-123032700588_1.html)

bihar finally rolled out a bridge maintenance policy after 10 years in development, requiring departments to maintain ""health cards"" with detailed inspection records for all 6,200 bridges. but this was only done after repeated collapses forced their hand.
 
**the bottom line**

this is a full-blown infrastructure scam running across multiple states. the same contractors who build substandard bridges get fresh tenders after collapses because of political connections, commission systems, and deliberate lack of accountability. hundreds have died, investigations go nowhere, suspensions are reversed, blacklisting is bypassed by changing company names, and the cycle continues.

the system is designed to benefit contractors and politicians while putting public lives at risk. until there's genuine enforcement of blacklisting, independent audits, criminal prosecution, and breaking the commission system, this will keep happening."

reddit,2025-10-18 13:57:49,"indian professor exposes the hypocrisy: western countries that freely migrated for centuries now restrict indians while lecturing us about not signing the refugee convention western countries are tightening restrictions on indian students and workers, there are literal protests in europe against refugees from countries they themselves destabilized, and somehow we still get lectured about not signing the 1951 refugee convention.

an indian legal scholar has just published a detailed takedown of this hypocrisy that's worth understanding. professor b.s. chimni, india's leading scholar on third world approach to international law has an article in the journal of refugee studies that lays out some historical facts that rarely get mentioned when westerners talk about migration.

between 1850 and 1920, about 40 million europeans left for other continents and went to americas, australia, even parts of africa and asia. they often just took land from indigenous people and settled there, no visas, no point based systems, no questions asked. that was a massive percentage of europe's population moving around completely freely without any restrictions.

now, if we put this in today's context and if people from developing countries including india had migrated at that same rate since world war ii, roughly 800 million people would have moved to wealthier countries. instead, only 0.8% of the developing world's workforce has migrated to industrialized nations which is one twentieth the european rate.

and yet when even this tiny fraction tries to move for education or work, we face increasingly harsh restrictions. uk keeps changing visa rules for indian students,canada just cut immigration targets with australia tightening skilled migration and trump less we speak, the better. interesting to note that trump's own grandfather was a german immigrant and he himself doesn't have very old us lineage to spew such nonsense on immigration, anyway, i digrees, moving on..

during the colonial period, european powers also moved between 12 and 37 million people from colonized regions as indentured labor. they extracted resources, destabilized local economies, and created conditions that still drive migration today. by 1770, nearly 2.5 million enslaved people in the americas were producing a third of total european commerce value, but now immigration is a crisis for them.

chimni points out something even more relevant to recent events. many major refugee situations in the last few decades happened because of western military interventions. afghanistan, iraq, libya, syria. these countries were destabilized directly by western policies. and now refugees from these places face closed doors and literal protests when trying to reach the very nations whose bombs destroyed their homes.

there are protests in europe against syrian refugees. think about that, the very same us and european countries participated in interventions that contributed to syria's destruction, and now there are protests against people fleeing that destruction trying to reach safety. and then, with all this history, with all this hypocrisy, we get questioned about why india hasn't signed the 1951 refugee convention.

let's be clear about that this convention was written in 1951, literally during the colonial era when most of the global south was still colonized or just gaining independence. during the cold war, western countries used it generously to accept refugees from communist nations because it served their geopolitical interests and it was proof that the other side's system was failing. then the cold war ended and refugee flows started coming from developing countries to developed ones. suddenly the same treaty became the basis for keeping people out. the legal text didn't change but what changed was who was seeking refuge and whether accepting them benefited powerful countries.

now the convention is used as a tool of containment with western countries haveing built what scholars call a non entree regime, basically a system of barriers to prevent refugees from even reaching their territory to claim protection. they externalize border controls, they pay other countries to hold refugees, they use technology to keep people out.

and somehow we're supposed to sign up for this? we're supposed to take on legal obligations under a system designed during colonialism, that western countries themselves don't meaningfully follow anymore, while they restrict our citizens from coming to their countries for legitimate purposes?

chimni's article documents that only 7% of academic research about refugees comes from scholars in developing countries, even though 80% of refugees live here. the entire field is dominated by western universities that focus on what's happening in western countries and systematically exclude perspectives from regions that actually host most refugees.

india already hosts refugees. we have tibetans, sri lankan tamils, afghans, rohingya, and others. we do this without being party to the convention, based on our own traditions and policies. we're not perfect, there are issues with how some groups are treated, but we're not the ones going around destabilizing other countries and then refusing to take responsibility for the displacement we caused.

the article makes clear that the current system serves western interests. when it was convenient during the cold war, refugees were welcome. and now that it's inconvenient, the same legal framework is used to keep them out. meanwhile, western countries whose policies directly created refugee crises face minimal responsibility for the consequences.

and yet somehow the conversation is always about what developing countries should be doing, never about the historical responsibility of countries that colonized half the world, that extracted resources for centuries, that intervened militarily in dozens of countries, and that benefited from migration freedom when it suited them.

update 1 - a lot of people are thinking this post implies the article or i am advocating that western countries should take indians or other immigrants without conditions or restrictions. that's not the idea. the paper clearly states that 80% of refugees live in the global south. for example, when afghanistan was ravaged by american intervention, afghans didn't fly directly to washington. they took refuge in neighboring countries like india and still live here. but who created the mess? the us did.

yet if you talk to the us and other western countries, they lecture india about how we should sign the refugee convention or its protocol like them, and how we're a terrible nation for not doing so. this despite the fact we've hosted tibetans, afghans, rohingyas, bangladeshis, sri lankans and others in times of crisis. this is the hypocrisy of the west, not one country in particular but their collective stand on the issue."

note: had to add some points from electoral bond scam here.

**the electoral bonds scam exposed contractor-political nexus**

when the supreme court struck down electoral bonds as unconstitutional and forced data release, it exposed perhaps the biggest quid pro quo scam in independent india. the data revealed a direct ""corporate-political nexus"" where contractors gave donations and got government contracts in return. 

senior congress leader jairam ramesh called electoral bonds ""pre-paid"", ""post-paid"" and ""post-raid"" bribes, through which the central government had given rs 3.8 lakh crore in projects and contracts to private companies in exchange for rs 2,004 crore in donations to bjp. in 49 cases, rs 62,000 crore in post-paid contracts/project approvals were given by the centre or bjp-led state governments, for which rs 580 crore in ""kickbacks"" in electoral bonds were given to the bjp within a three-month span.

**infrastructure companies were top electoral bond donors**

infrastructure and construction companies were among the top political donors through electoral bonds. source: [business-standard](https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/infra-firms-among-top-electoral-bond-donors-124031501120_1.html)

megha engineering &amp; infrastructure ltd (meil) alone gave rs 670 crore to bjp over five years, making it the single largest donor to any party. much of this came after income tax raids on the company in october. the company defeated international bids and won the strategic zoji-la tunnel contract in ladakh near china border. union minister gadkari praised them in parliament saying ""megha's bid saved the government rs 5,000 crore."" 

but when political winds changed in telangana before 2023 elections, meil's donation pattern changed too. the company bought more bonds and donated nearly rs 100 crore to congress (the favorite according to opinion polls), making meil among congress's top donors. in december 2023, congress was elected to power in telangana.

vedanta ltd purchased bonds worth rs 10 crore to be donated to congress in july 2023. by november 2023, vedanta was allowed to set up a mineral beneficiation plant in karnataka. the cost of the project is estimated to be around rs 225 crore. 

gvpr engineers ltd, a hyderabad-based company, faced protests from local farmers while setting up a private port in honnavar, coastal karnataka. subsequently, gvpr made political donations by purchasing bonds and donating rs 5 crore to bjp and congress. the company's subsidiary hppl secured the contract for this port project under the centre's sagarmala project worth rs 600 crore. survey work commenced in january 2024.

**the ""khatta meetha"" model - deliberately keeping roads bad**

remember the akshay kumar movie where contractors deliberately add less cement in concrete mixture to built a roads to get repeat contracts? that's happening in real life across india. 

in mumbai, six contractors named in bmc's road scam inquiry bagged rs 4,259 crore out of rs 4,600 crore total road contracts in just three years between november 2012 and may 2015. with less than a month's rainfall, more than 700 potholes were found on city roads. some of these roads were even in the defect liability period - the guarantee period where contractors are supposed to repair at their own cost.

in navi mumbai, a road stretch from dmart to haware mall junction in nerul east was repaired with a new asphalt layer just two months earlier in may 2024. the work cost nearly rs 3 crore. within two months, numerous potholes appeared on this site. as per pwd notification of 2017, asphalt roads must have a life guarantee of 15 years, while concrete roads should last at least 25 years. rti activist anarjit chauhan said: ""this means that either the executive engineer is ignorant about the quality of the repaired road, or he or she is intentionally ignoring the poor quality of work done.""

**jharkhand road deliberately destroyed for fresh tender**

a viral video from dumka, jharkhand showed a perfectly good, recently built road being broken by jcb machines. the allegation is that the road was deliberately destroyed to get a fresh tender. 

a reddit post from august 2025 stated: ""in jharkhand, they've mastered a new scam — destroy a freshly built road, get a new tender, and pocket crores. the road that was just fine yesterday is now being torn apart. why? because there's more money in reconstruction than in maintenance."" 

source: [reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/jharkhand/comments/1mm97lv/in_jharkhand_theyve_mastered_a_new_scam_destroy_a/)

**the defect liability period manipulation**

here's how sophisticated this scam is. every government contract has a defect liability period (dlp) - typically 5 years for asphalt roads and 15 years for concrete roads. during this period, if the road develops defects, the contractor must repair it at their own expense. but officials and contractors collude to let this period expire without repairs, so a fresh tender worth crores can be issued for ""reconstruction.""

in palwal, haryana, residents and social workers exposed this scam and faced fir for it. activist shantnu thakur alleged: ""the pwd department is responsible for maintaining roads for five years. instead of repairing the road, they allowed the period to lapse, so a new tender worth rs 2.5 crore could be issued for reconstruction. this appears to be a way to pocket money again instead of fulfilling maintenance obligations."" officials were delaying action even after multiple complaints from villagers since february 2022, claiming interlocking tiles and proper surfacing were not done according to contract, but still no corrective action was taken until activists visited their office.

in pune, a rs 25 lakh road project on dnyandeep colony lane number 1 developed cracks and damage within days of construction. only after karvenagar citizens forum filed a complaint did pmc issue notice to the contractor. civic activist vivek velankar said: ""ideally, pmc should have monitored the road's condition and issued the notice proactively. it's surprising that the civic body had to slap the notice after we filed the complaint."" activist tanmay kanitkar said: ""generally residents neglect the defect liability period clause mentioned in the contract of civic projects.""

after the gambhira bridge collapse in gujarat that killed 22 people, the state government issued notices to over 25 contractors falling within the defect liability period who have been asked to repair 659 km of damaged roads across 17 municipal corporations. sources stated this is the first such massive campaign against contractors over road damages - meaning for years, the dlp was simply ignored.

**contractors show their power through boycott**

after bmc cracked down on contractors involved in the rs 352 crore road repair scam, the contractor lobby showed their real power. bmc was unable to find a contractor to undertake annual pothole-filling work during monsoon. bmc invited tenders three times but received very poor response. in the third round, only one contractor showed interest for the island city, while none responded for eastern and western suburbs. that contractor's bid was over 45% above estimates, so bmc couldn't appoint him. 

officials admitted that the contractor lobby was playing hardball by staying away from bidding for critical pothole-filling contracts to build pressure on the civic administration. with no response from contractors, bmc was forced to ask the pre-monsoon-work contractors to fill potholes during monsoon too, though officials weren't sure how sincerely they would carry out the job. 

source: [indianexpress](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/after-road-repair-scam-crackdown-bmc-finds-no-contractors-to-fill-potholes-during-rains-2857662/)

this is the same contractor cartel that pocketed rs 4,259 crore in three years. when action was taken, they simply boycotted tenders, forcing bmc to give them work anyway.

despite firs being registered against six contractors and two chief engineers being suspended, bmc was still set to pay rs 324 crore to the same contractors mired in the road scam because work had to continue.

**the complete cycle - how it all works**

here's the complete business model (correct me if i am wrong):

step 1: infrastructure company gives political donation (chanda) through electoral bonds or other means to ruling party - anywhere from rs 5 crore to rs 670 crore

step 2: company gets cherry-picked for government contracts worth 10-100 times their donation within weeks or months. often ed/cbi/it raids are dropped after donations.

step 3: for every rs 100 contract, rs 15-25 goes to officials and politicians as commission to get payments released. this forces contractors to work with only 60-75% of budget.

step 4: contractors use substandard materials, skip proper engineering, and deliberately build poor quality infrastructure to maintain profit margins.

step 5: infrastructure collapses or develops defects within months. roads get potholes, bridges show cracks.

step 6: during defect liability period, contractor and officials collude to not repair defects. they wait for dlp to expire.

step 7: once dlp expires, fresh tender is issued for ""reconstruction"" or ""major repairs"" - worth crores again.

step 8: same contractor or contractor cartel wins the fresh tender (after fresh donations if needed).

step 9: if any investigation happens, contractors are suspended but later reinstated. firs are filed but cases don't conclude for years. companies change names to bypass blacklisting.

step 10: meanwhile, contractor lobby shows power by boycotting tenders if pressure increases. government is forced to give them work anyway.

step 11: repeat from step 3.

**the bihar tender scam**

enforcement directorate conducted fresh searches in a money laundering case linked to an alleged contractor-bureaucrats nexus in bihar government tender irregularities.

the scale of bihar's contractor-bureaucrat nexus is evident from 12 bridges collapsing in just 20 days in 2024, all built by contractors with political connections. 

source: [indianexpress](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/indrayani-to-vadodara-3-major-bridges-that-collapsed-in-2025-10115854/)

**the bottom line**

this is not corruption - this is a full-blown business model. electoral bonds data proved what everyone knew - you give chanda, you get theka (contract), you build substandard work, it collapses or deteriorates, you get fresh theka. the contractor-politician-bureaucrat nexus ensures nobody gets punished, investigations go nowhere, and the same people keep getting richer while infrastructure keeps collapsing and killing people.

the supreme court struck down electoral bonds, but the business model continues through shell companies, cash donations, and other means. until there's genuine enforcement, independent monitoring, citizen activism, and breaking this nexus, indian taxpayers will keep paying for the same road to be built again and again while contractors and politicians split the loot.

**ending: a message to indian youth - it's time to wake up**

if you've read this far, you now know the truth. every pothole you dodge, every bridge collapse you read about, every exam paper leak that destroys dreams - it's not incompetence. it's not bad luck. it's not ""that's just how india is.""

you pay taxes honestly. they steal it systematically. you follow rules. they change them for profit. you prepare for exams. they sell the papers. you drive on bad roads. they bank the money meant to fix them. you die in bridge collapses. 

and then they tell you india is developing. 

you have more power than you think. mukesh chandrakar was one journalist who exposed a rs 120 crore scam before they killed him. but there are 70 crore youth in this country. they can't kill all of us. they can't silence all of us.

**the choice is yours**, you can scroll past this post, feel angry for 5 minutes, and go back to life. next year, another bridge will collapse. your tax will fund the rebuild. the same contractor will get the tender. more people will die. more students will commit suicide. more journalists will be murdered. and you'll feel angry for 5 minutes again.

or you can save this post. share it with sources intact. file one rti. join one citizens' group. support one independent journalist. vote with knowledge. speak up once when everyone is silent.

your grandfather's generation fought the british and won freedom. your father's generation stayed silent and lost it to corruption. your generation has smartphones, internet, rti, social media, and supreme court judgments on your side.

you're either going to be the generation that let india become a corporate-political loot machine, or the generation that said enough and fought back with facts, laws, and persistence. mukesh chandrakar died collecting evidence. students are committing suicide. people are dying in bridge collapses. your tax money is being stolen. 

what are you going to do about it? 

the choice has always been yours. silence is also a choice. and they're counting on you to stay silent.  don't...."
reddit,2025-10-19 00:42:30,"extreme distaste for technology and automation investments by small and medium businesses. why? i am based in us, have been for few years, but did work in india for years before moving.

recently, a relative who owns a small business and a brand for cooking oil, pretty popular in western region, reached out for a solution for automation in dispensing oil.

their current method is regardless of temperature or density or viscosity, they pour oil on a scale and keep pouring until desired weight is reached. takes too long, and causes work to flow over into overtime, despite having two 8/9 hour shifts.

so, they reach out to me for a solution. i give them a total system solution, automated oil dispensing, based on calibrated load cells, plc programmed, automated electro-pneumatic valve, tank heating solution to keep oil warm so its always flowing - based on gas heating, since gas is available.

total cost was about inr 35l. would have moved them into a single shift, more productivity, tracked their batches with dispensing memory storage, and given multiple features, allowing their people to focus on stuff like shipping, packaging etc.

provided with multiple stripped down versions as well. lowest cost was about 20l.

decided not to go ahead with it, ""too much investment needed"". payback period was less than 2 years, considering savings from reduced shift, capacity expansions, despite the need for air compressor and a gas based hot water heater.

we do business with some small and medium sized businesses in india. there is a consistent distrust of investing in automation and newer technology. even when the payback period or roi exists, say above 11% per year, which is what major stock indices in india return year-on-year on average.

why? why is there such a hesitancy in investing in automation? yes, i realize labor is very cheap, but even in cases, where return is evident, costs lower than even the cheap labor, small businesses or medium businesses don't want to invest in automation?

another issue is technology. i have seen small businesses using windows 7 or windows 10, not getting microsoft business suite of apps. one business we work with, refused to even get a shareable dashboard on powerbi, and until our vp of us business threatened pulling back work, did they get microsoft office apps, and even then a single account. their whole data is still a mess.

the same small business refuses to install a scheduling application, and instead wants to do scheduling manually, frequently causing issues and lack of transparency, if our urgent priority orders have even been scheduled or planned.

another business based in bengaluru, which is supposed to be the tech capital, insists on using solidedge, a 3-d cad program by siemens, instead of what our entire network uses - solidworks. with all our vendors using solidworks, we can leverage spare facility capacity across the world to make spare parts and problem is except for the indian business, as sharing models and sub-assemblies across platforms is a horrendous, painstaking journey. what this results in, even if the indian business has spare capacity, they won't get more work just because nobody wants to put in assemblies in solidedge from solidworks and go through ensuring that stuff doesn't get screwed up.

otoh, chinese. vietnamese and thai companies we work with, even small ones, are absolutely extremely happy to get onboard, at a request, not the threat of pulling back work. why is there a massive difference in attitudes towards getting on-board with newer technology or automation in indian businesses?

what can be done to encourage small and medium sized businesses to be welcoming instead of being so hesitant?"

reddit,2025-10-24 11:55:54,"why is delhi so unwalkable i honestly don’t get it. delhi is a massive city with millions of people, but it feels like it was never meant for anyone to actually walk anywhere. the footpaths, if they exist at all, are either broken, filled with garbage, occupied by parked cars or street vendors, or they just randomly vanish halfway down the road. you can’t even walk a kilometre without risking your life dodging bikes, autos, or cars that think sidewalks are parking spots.

it’s wild how in other cities around the world, walking is just… normal. you can walk through entire neighbourhoods in places like london, new york, or even bangkok without feeling like you’re playing a survival game. in delhi, even a short distance that should take ten minutes turns into a mission.

and the sad part is, it’s not even about the heat or pollution half the time. it’s just that the city isn’t built for people. everything is designed for cars. there’s barely any shade, pedestrian crossings are a joke, and drivers act like they’ve never seen someone walk before.

it makes me wonder if it’s bad planning, or if walking is just seen as something people shouldn’t do once they can afford a vehicle. either way, it’s frustrating as hell. a capital city shouldn’t feel like it’s actively hostile to pedestrians."
reddit,2025-10-24 12:45:57,"satellite town ring road lanes should be 8-16 instead of 4-6 i recently travelled on the strr and started thinking about what its actual purpose of the so-called prestigious strr? the current outer ring road (orr) is already 6 lanes, though it’s been stuck in metro construction chaos for years. but this new strr why make it only 4 to 6 lanes? it should’ve been at least 8 lanes + emergency lanes if we’re really planning for future traffic. it was planned to bypass the heavy vehicles traffic inside the city but with 4 lanes it’s very difficult as majority of the vehicles always occupies both lanes.

i don’t want to sound like i’m comparing cities, but hyderabad’s orr is honestly a state-of-the-art highway. it started over a decade ago(2013) and the way they’ve planned entry/exit points and managed heavy vehicles is just brilliant. you can literally drive smoothly without random trucks blocking the fast lane.it’s currently 8 lanes and additional emergency lane and mostly 2 wheelers are not allowed.

on the other hand, strr already feels half done. two lanes are constantly occupied by heavy trucks, and even the so-called fast lane is often taken by slow-moving vehicles. i’ve travelled only from hoskote to devanahalli, and while some stretches are 6 lanes, others suddenly narrow down to 4. that inconsistency is a real problem.

what’s even more confusing is that strr is already far from the city so land acquisition shouldn’t have been that costly or difficult. why didn’t the government (both state and central) plan this more aggressively, keeping in mind bangalore’s explosive growth?

at first, they hooked me up with an airtel router. okay, not great, but at least it kinda worked. speed was still crap, so i complained, and they ""upgraded"" me to one of their own company routers. holy shit, this thing was ancient – looked like it was pulled from a dumpster. the speed got even worse! pages wouldn't load, downloads crawled, and forget about streaming. i tested it for like a few hours and was like, fuck this noise.

called them back immediately and demanded they switch me back to the airtel one. and get this – the asshole on the phone says they've already given my router to another customer! what the actual fuck? who does that? it's not even been a day! then, instead of fixing it, this moron starts pulling up my usage stats from the last 6 days, like ""look how much data you've used already."" bitch, i don't give a shit about that – just give me back the goddamn router that at least halfway worked!

i kept pushing, telling them to sort their shit out, and what do they do? without even asking for my permission, they straight-up cancel my plan on the spot and tell me to ""go use bsnl instead."" are you kidding me? what kind of retarded customer care is this? no apology, no refund discussion, just ""fuck you, go elsewhere."" i've been without internet now because of these incompetent pricks.

i bought their aquaguard water purifier more than an year ago which cost me nearly 20k with prefilter and installation.

1. i raised a service request right before my warranty expiration so that i can make use of warranty before expiration.

but to my surprise my service request was close without any service done.
i didn't pay attention to it as my purifier is working fine.

2. couple of months after this the water started to taste salty and after few days its completely stopped working and the servicing light started blinking.

since there is no way to make it work, i paid for their amc of rs 699 (thank god i didn't buy the 6k one) and raised a new service request.

days passed by and i kept following up on the service. after few weeks i fed up with this and i raised it on social media, and escalated it. 

now some case manager calls me and tells me that product model is incorrect on the portal, which is auto registered by sales person or company guy and not by me.

and i can't correct this product model by myself on app and neither by the case manager who called.

so im order to get this corrected, i was on their chat support almost for a whole day multiple chats later they added the right product to my account.

now the next problem, the amc i purchased is still on old device, which i have to get transferred to new product.

i spent some more time with customer support and they keep promising they will transfer it and they need some time since this requires approval (idk what kind of approval they are seeking for a 699 rs amc membership, president or ceo?)

now i get calls every week after week and i keep listening the same shit again and again with no resolution. 

its been more than 2 months since my purifier is sitting brick, while i am taking the trouble of buying purified water and carrying it to my home every day.

i also raised grievance with national consumer helpline, but no support from their either.

india is probably only country, which collects taxes like europe, while having quality of life of bangladesh.

its bad enough that you don't get purified water for from government itself. its worse that i despite buying my own purifier, i have 0 consumer rights and 0 support from government."

reddit,2025-10-27 08:31:56,"“i don’t hate dogs — but my right to sleep and move freely is gone because of irresponsible ‘dog lovers’ next door.” before anyone judges me — no, i don’t hate dogs and i’ve never harmed one. but i honestly don’t know whose rights come first anymore — the dogs’ or the humans’ fundamental rights to sleep peacefully and move freely in their own street.

i’m writing this at 6 a.m. out of sheer frustration. we live in a decent neighbourhood — or at least it used to be. there are a few empty plots everyone uses for parking and kids playing. my father’s best friend lives next door with his unemployed son, daughter, and wife. they have plenty of free time, act like the biggest dog lovers, but are rude to elders and talk behind everyone’s back.

about 3–4 years ago, some stray dogs started hanging around. this family began feeding them, and now the dogs treat the whole street like their personal territory. the couple claims they “keep the dogs outside at night for safety,” but in reality, they chain or lock them in empty plots or keep them indoors. the dogs cry through the night, and around 5:30 a.m. they release them — right when milkmen, maids, and walkers come out.

several people have been chased or bitten, yet they always say “they don’t bite” or “they just didn’t recognize you.” from their balcony, they’ll shout “kallu, stop!” while the dog runs after someone — as if that magically helps.

when neighbours held a small meeting, most people spoke sweetly like “we’re not against dogs, but this is getting out of hand,” but behind their backs everyone agreed it’s completely wrong. only my parents and one elderly lady spoke openly. that lady was rudely told by the dog lover’s wife, “aapne apne bachon ko sanskaar nahi diye — you’re speaking against dogs!” since when is asking for safety a sign of bad upbringing?

here’s the irony: the same uncle who calls himself an animal lover beats cows and buffaloes with a stick if they enter the lane, but worships dogs like gods. their “dog love” is more like a showcase — i’ll keep them when i want, release them when i want, but if they bite or chase someone, it’s not my fault because they’re ‘awaara’.

they’ve even started telling street vendors, kabadiwalas, and beggars not to enter the street, saying “if anything happens, not our problem.” what about their right to work and move freely? they literally laugh when dogs chase people.

we had to soundproof our room because of constant barking. these dogs aren’t trained — just territorial and aggressive because of how they’re treated. i’ve seen other stray dogs in nearby streets who are calm and non-violent because they aren’t made to feel like they “own” the place.

now every guest who visits has to inform us first, and we walk them out to the main road to make sure the dogs don’t run after them. it’s honestly dadagiri — their love, our loss.

it’s always the same story: our love, our freedom — your responsibility.
they claim to be dog lovers but take no responsibility when someone is bitten, scared, or can’t sleep at night.

i respect genuine dog lovers who care responsibly. but this is pure selfishness disguised as compassion — and it’s costing people their peace, safety, and fundamental rights.

sorry for venting, but i’m exhausted. what can i actually do — legally or practically? i can’t wear earplugs forever or adjust my entire life around their dogs’ schedule.
love for animals shouldn’t mean cruelty towards humans."

yes, india is still a low to lower middle income country. but of late, many indians have been going to similarly lower (middle) income countries in asia and africa and we have google street view everywhere. countries like vietnam have similar incomes as richer indian states (15-20k usd by ppp). but the cleanliness, urban spaces, as well as aesthetic sense are leagues ahead of anywhere in india. rwanda, a country much poorer than india, is becoming renowned for being extremely clean and safe. 

now you might say that these countries have authoritarian regimes and laws. singapore is another diverse asian country that became one of the richest in the world through draconian measures. so it seems democracy only works in homogeneous populations. 

until you consider mauritius. it's an island country where indians, chinese, africans, and some europeans were brought together and forced to mingle. half the population is hindu. it is now a high income country with advanced infrastructure and quality of life. and it's a democracy with a democracy index score above those of most european nations and the us. 

so low income or democracy in a diverse society is not what's stopping india from progressing. mindset is the only explanation. we're content to accept the deplorable conditions we have and focus on religious and ethnic divisions as well as moral outrage at trivial issues."

i am unable to:

* **surrender gst registration**
* close the entity formally
* stop statutory compliance expenses
* stop rent and minimum electricity charges
* clear worker dues
* or restart operations

**only because the matter is not being listed.**  
i am **not asking for judgment**, only the right to be **heard**.

# request for practical guidance

if anyone familiar with bombay high court procedure can guide me on:

1. the correct and effective way to request **urgent listing** (mentioning / circulation / production list).
2. whether i should continue pursuing **permission to appear in person** (i have already given the interview).
3. whether requesting listing before **vacation bench** is advisable.
4. any practical steps that help when livelihood impact is already severe.

# i say this with full respect

i have always believed in the judiciary and continue to do so.  
my request is simply that the matter be placed before the court, so that i may speak, and the court may decide.  
a chance to be heard — nothing more.

i will attach a **redacted version** of my latest reminder letter in the comments (without personal contact details).

thank you to everyone who is reading, advising, sharing, and standing with me through this.  
your support is helping me maintain strength during this extremely difficult time."

reddit,2025-10-29 20:23:13,"gba elections, our chance to change things.  maybe. on nov 1, 2025, the karnataka government will officially declare the creation of 368 wards within the greater bengaluru authority region.  this would probably be the final step before the government can decide on when to hold elections in bengaluru after almost a decade of not having elected representatives at the corporation level.  hopefully, the notification for elections would be done late this year or early next year.   

on paper, with more wards in each of the 5 corporations, it offers a chance of better governance.  even though the ward mapping was done against the 2011 census it still appears to be better than the previous mapping where some of the wards had grown beyond any control.  smaller ward areas offer citizens hope.  

if rwas, resident groups, colonies can come together and put pressure on parties to have good candidates, those with ethics, a vision, integrity, we could improve things on the ground. smaller wards also offer the chance for the communities to come together and put up their own candidates.  beyond caste, language, one among us could make a difference too in this scenario.  the second option would be their biggest nightmare.  all of us coming together can change our future. 

it's not an easy task and nothing will change overnight, but if we do not discuss and think about this in the coming weeks/months, we will end up here for the next few years complaining about roads, footpaths, garbage, transport, water, lakes and rivers among everything else. 

we have a lot of urban experts around, the iim, the iisc, are we tapping them enough to improve the situation in our city.  we can surely do better than a few kms of tender sure.  if we can build great roads and pavements around our airport, why can’t we extend them all over.    

corruption and inefficiencies must be addressed.  the bus stop shelters that keep coming up next to each other, the manhole that collapses every 2 months.  someone must own and address it for sure.  we want transparency, we cannot just submit requests to aros and keep visiting the offices several times until bribes are paid.  every request submitted to any official has to be tracked, every rupee spent by the govt on its citizens must be tracked and published.  we must come together, stop paying bribes and end corruption.  this is slowing our progress as a city and if not now, it's never. 

this is our chance to get the best candidates elected, ensure participation in ward committees and hold the officials accountable for their actions. 

we should also get out and vote, if you have lived here long enough, make sure that you have your name on the voters list.   50% voting percentages aren't good enough, we should push for the 80s at least if not more.  with smaller wards, the margin of victory could be in 100s.  so, let's ensure this happens too.   together, we can make the city more livable.   

let's start now."

do we even need the tunnel road if the route almost entirely overlaps with the long-overdue red line of namma metro! sankey tank is part of bangalore's heritage. how can we casually risk its destruction for a new road! the apparent disregard for our heritage and well-being is so apparent in the actions of the karnataka government.

reddit,2025-10-30 19:51:29,"an engineer's perspective on a dakla ceremony. what i saw and what i figured out **7 impossible claims, 7 perfect hits: how a dakla ceremony almost made me believe**

i'm an engineer from gujarat. i don't believe in superstition. i believe in data, logic, and evidence.

but on one night in october 2025, i saw things that made me question everything.

120 people. one temple. hours of daklas. three people shaking violently, claiming to be possessed by our family goddess. and then—seven specific claims about our family history. all of them true. every single one.

i was there. i saw it with my own eyes. and for a moment—just a moment—i believed.

here's what i saw. here's what i figured out. and here's why it matters.

# act 1: the setup

**the problem**

my extended family—250 people across five generations, spread across 15-20 houses in rural gujarat—was suffering. cancer diagnoses. debt. broken marriages. deaths that felt too soon, too sudden.

the kind of pain that makes you search for reasons. for patterns. for someone to blame. and the answer they arrived at? our family goddess (kuldevi) was angry. or an ancestor's spirit was taking revenge. or some malevolent force was haunting us.

the family elders made a decision: we'd organize a dakla ceremony at our family temple.

**the expert arrives**

a man was invited from a village 120 km away. his job? when dakla players perform and someone becomes possessed—by a goddess, an ancestor, or a troubled spirit—he communicates with them to seek answers. no information about our family was shared with him beforehand. this is important. remember that.

**the ceremony begins**

night fell. the daklas started.

*boom. boom. boom.*

the sound was hypnotic. relentless. the kind of rhythm that gets into your bones.

around 120 people sat in the temple courtyard, watching. waiting.

and then, it started.

# act 2: the evidence

**part a: the possession**

three people began to shake. violently. their bodies convulsing, heads rolling, eyes unfocused.

two of them were regulars at these ceremonies—men in their 30s and 40s who'd been ""possessed"" before.

but the third? a 16-year-old boy who'd never experienced this before the event. now he was shaking like electricity was running through him.

**part b: the number trick**

then came the first test.

a family member went into the inner temple, took blessings from the goddess, and wrote a number from 1 to 4 on his palm. nobody else saw it. not the expert. not the possessed. nobody.

he came back out.

one of the possessed men spoke:

**""two.""**

the family member opened his palm.

it was 2.

the crowd gasped. i felt my stomach drop.

**part c: the failures**

but then... things got weird.

they tried another test. this time, selecting a specific person from the crowd. the possessed tried. and failed.

they tried again with grains of wheat—3000 to 5000 grains spread out, and the possessed had to identify which one had been marked.

they tried. once. twice. three times.

eight to ten attempts total.

every single time: failure.

the expert's explanation? ""the goddess isn't happy yet. the connection isn't strong enough.""

the ceremony continued. the daklas kept beating. hours passed.

**part d: the finale**

early morning arrived. the sky was beginning to lighten. everyone was exhausted.

and then, suddenly, the expert himself got possessed. coherently.

and what he said... stopped everyone cold.

**""whose family had an ancestor named 'devraj'?""** (name changed)

a hand went up. yes. my great-grandfather.

**""are there three people in this family suffering from cancer?""**

murmurs. confirmations. yes. three people.

**""did someone die by jumping into a well?""**

silence. then a nod. yes. decades ago.

**""did someone die by hanging?""**

another nod. yes.

**""did an adult unmarried girl die?""**

someone's eyes filled with tears. yes. she died young. seizures.

**""in whose house is there a dead tree still standing?""**

multiple hands. yes. several houses.

**""has anyone filed a false court case against a family member?""**

uncomfortable shifting. yes. there was a property dispute. family rivalry. a false accusation.

seven claims. seven hits. perfect accuracy.

then, the final act: in front of everyone, the expert drank an entire bowl of sindoor—the red vermillion powder.

he didn't choke. didn't cough. just drank it.

everyone was convinced. the goddess had spoken.

i wanted to believe. i almost did.

# act 3: the crack

for days afterward, i couldn't stop thinking about it.

seven perfect hits. the number trick. the sindoor drinking. how?

and then it hit me.

**why didn't they repeat the grain test at the end?**

think about it:

* **the 1-4 number trick**: worked (25% chance—totally possible)
* **the people selection**: failed
* **the grain selection**: failed 8-10 times (\~0.02% chance—almost impossible)
* **the seven claims**: came only at the end, after hours of ceremony
* **the grain test again**: never attempted

if this was truly the goddess at her strongest moment—after successfully revealing seven family secrets—why not prove it definitively with the grain test?

**because they demonstrated what was statistically achievable and avoided what wasn't.**

that's when i knew. this wasn't supernatural. this was psychology.

# act 4: the dismantling

**part a: who were the ""possessed""?**

let's talk about who got possessed:

**person 1 &amp; 2:** regular attendees of such ceremonies. they've done this before. multiple times.

**person 3:** a 16-year-old boy attending for the first time.

here's what's crucial: **all three are members of our extended family.**

they grew up hearing family stories. **they're not faking.** they're in what psychologists call a **dissociative trance state**—a real, measurable altered state of consciousness.

**the science of possession states**

research on dissociative trance states (found in religious ceremonies worldwide—from pentecostal churches to shamanic rituals) shows:

1. **rhythmic drumming** at certain frequencies (4–7 hz, theta wave range) can induce altered states of consciousness
2. **prolonged sensory stimulation** combined with fatigue lowers psychological barriers
3. **social expectation** creates a psychological permission structure: ""it's not me talking, it's the goddess""
4. **suppressed knowledge surfaces**: information you know but don't consciously think about emerges
5. **it feels completely real** to the person experiencing it

the 16-year-old wasn't faking. his brain genuinely entered an altered state where suppressed family knowledge—stories heard from elders, conversations overheard—came pouring out.

think of it like this: hypnosis is real. sleepwalking is real. trance states are real. the brain is capable of incredible things. none of it requires supernatural explanation.

**part b: the statistical takedown**

now, let's look at those seven ""miraculous"" claims. i'm going to apply actual statistics to my family numbers:

**reminder:** 250 total people (across 5 generations from \~1875–2025), 170 currently alive, 80 deceased, 15–20 houses.

**claim 1: ""whose family had ancestor named devraj?""**

devraj is a name derived from a god, **historically common** among gujaratis.  
expected for our family: **1–5 people** with variants of this name.  
asking this in rural gujarat is like asking, “did anyone in your english family have a john?”

**claim 2: ""three people with cancer?""**

1 in 9 indians will develop cancer.  
170 living people ÷ 9 = \~19 expected.  
3 active cases = below average. not miraculous.

**claim 3 &amp; 4: ""death by well"" and ""death by hanging""**

suicides: 8–12% of deaths in rural india.  
of those: 64% by hanging, \~9% by drowning/well.  
for our 80 deceased: 6–10 suicides expected.  
so 4–6 hangings and 1 drowning = statistically expected.

**claim 5: ""unmarried girl who died""**

epilepsy prevalence \~5–6 per 1,000.  
250 people = 1–3 expected cases across generations.  
young unmarried woman dying from seizures is tragic—but not rare.

**claim 6: ""dead tree standing""**

15–20 rural homes → almost guaranteed that some have dead trees.  
tree mortality and cultural reasons make this **100% probable**.

**claim 7: ""false court case filed""**

66% of indian civil cases are land/property disputes.  
15–20 houses → multiple inheritance lines.  
a false case in an extended indian family? **virtually guaranteed.**

**part c: the ceremony architecture**

**the setup:**

1. hours of drumming (theta wave induction)
2. late night → fatigue
3. 120 witnesses → social pressure
4. atmosphere → sensory overload
5. failures excused (“goddess not ready yet”)
6. successes timed for peak suggestibility

**the questioning strategy:**  
he didn’t state facts—he asked *questions*.  
""whose family had ancestor devraj?""  
this prompts the crowd to volunteer info—classic **cold reading**.

**the barnum effect:**  
the statements *feel* specific but are statistically common:

* common name
* common disease
* common deaths
* common disputes
* common phenomena

**part d: the sindoor drinking**

""but he drank sindoor! that's impossible!""  
is it though?

fire-walkers, sword-swallowers, and glass-eaters exist.  
sindoor consumption could involve:

1. gradual tolerance building
2. quick swallowing
3. traditional know-how

painful? yes. supernatural? no.

# act 5: the bigger picture

**why this persists**

our brains are wired for **pattern recognition** and **social proof**.  
when 120 people believe something, your brain follows.

we remember the seven hits. we forget the 8–10 failures.

**the real cost**

it’s not money—it’s **critical thinking**.  
supernatural explanations delay real ones:

* epilepsy becomes “a curse”
* mental illness becomes “possession”
* medicine and therapy are delayed

**why i'm writing this**

not to mock anyone.  
not to call the expert a fraud.  
but to show: **everything supernatural that night had a natural explanation.**

critical thinking isn’t cynicism. it’s curiosity.

# closing: the reflection

that night, i almost believed in ghosts. in spirits. in divine possession.

now i understand something more fascinating: **the human mind.**

the daklas weren’t calling spirits—they were calling something within us.

those three possessed people weren’t frauds.  
they experienced real altered states.

the seven claims weren’t miracles.  
they were statistically inevitable.

the expert wasn’t necessarily a con artist.  
he was part of an ancient system that accidentally discovered psychology.

**and that’s more fascinating than any supernatural explanation could ever be.**

because it means *we* have the power.  
not the goddess. not the ancestors. not the spirits.

us.  
our brains. our pattern recognition. our capacity for trance states. our statistical likelihood of tragedy.

next time you see something ""unexplainable,"" ask:  
**""what’s the base rate? what am i not seeing?""**

you might be surprised.

**p.s.**  
you’re right—i can’t *prove* it wasn’t the goddess.  
but every single thing that happened can be explained naturally.  
and when natural explanations exist, **occam’s razor** applies.

the goddess didn’t speak that night.

but 250 years of family history, human psychology, and probability did.

and that’s okay.

*written by an engineer who almost believed, and who’s grateful he stopped to think.*

reddit,2025-10-31 00:40:50,"should chennai have a directly elected mayor? our monsoon chaos makes me think so. the recent rains in chennai weren’t even that heavy, yet the city practically came to a standstill. roads flooded, traffic jammed, power cuts everywhere—it’s the same old story. a few hours of rain, and the city slips into crisis mode.

it makes you wonder if we are ever truly prepared for the monsoon. year after year, the same promises come up: better stormwater drains, smarter planning, improved coordination. and yet, the coovum river continues to run like a city-wide embarrassment—a sewage channel cutting through chennai’s core, barely touched despite decades of plans and projects.

the real issue seems to be accountability. the chennai mayor’s office is treated more like an extended pr arm of the state government rather than an independent executive body. every initiative feels orchestrated, press conferences are choreographed, and the mayor often ends up playing the role of a city mascot rather than an empowered leader. it’s like watching the office being led around on a leash, with no autonomy to actually fix what’s broken.

what’s even more frustrating is how the state machinery uses every monsoon crisis as an opportunity for social media pr. ministers and political heirs wade through knee-deep water for photo-ops, issue dramatic statements, and post drone shots of “on-ground inspections.” the focus is rarely on fixing systemic failures—just on crafting the right viral moment. while citizens slog through flooded streets, the ruling class turns disaster management into a brand campaign.

in countries like the uk and canada—both parliamentary democracies like india—cities have directly elected mayors who possess genuine authority. london and toronto, for example, give their mayors real mandates to plan, execute, and be held accountable by the people, not the ruling party machinery.

maybe it’s time tamil nadu, and india at large, considers doing the same. a directly elected mayor for chennai could bring much-needed political independence and real accountability to urban governance. or is that too much power for state governments to ever willingly give up?"
reddit,2025-10-31 11:11:56,"why is it that many people in india still struggle to grasp the idea of quality of life? having spent a good chunk of my life in military stations, i think that’s why the outside world feels so overwhelming to me. life inside a cantonment is… well, it’s a different ball game. the roads are spotless, traffic flows smoothly, dogs are vaccinated and well-behaved, garbage gets picked up every day, and there’s this unspoken respect among everyone. kids can play freely in the streets, officers and jawans exchange polite greetings, and there’s a certain rhythm to life — calm, orderly, and dignified.

but then you step outside those gates — into what we call “civil life” — and it’s like you’ve landed on another planet.

it’s as if people here have made chaos their default mode. traffic jams are so common that folks have started scheduling their days around them. pedestrians stroll on the roads as if they have nine lives, while drivers honk like the horn is a magic button that gives them extra speed.

driving here isn’t just about getting from point a to b; it’s a battle for survival. everyone’s in a hurry, yet no one seems to be making any real progress. lane discipline? that’s just a fairy tale. red lights? optional. zebra crossings? merely a suggestion.

and the police? they seem completely unfazed. they’ll stop a 17-year-old on a scooter to check for a “license and rc,” but won’t bat an eye when an overloaded government bus swerves across three lanes, nearly causing an accident.

as for auto drivers? they navigate the roads like they’re on a suicide mission, probably with some political backing.

and heaven help you if a vip decides to take your route — suddenly, your time, your frustration, your fuel, and your sanity don’t matter at all. roads get blocked, police are stationed every few meters, and you find yourself stuck in traffic while some politician waves from an air-conditioned car, trying to show how much he “cares for the people.”

it’s astonishing how people can keep their homes spotless yet treat public spaces like they’re personal trash cans. you’ll see someone sweeping their doorstep in the morning, only to toss their garbage right on the corner of the same street.

street dogs and cows wander around, munching on plastic and garbage. dead animals lie unattended for days, while people stroll by as if it’s just part of the landscape.

and then you’ll hear someone chime in, “india is a spiritual country.”

sure, spiritual — but seems to have a serious allergy to responsibility.

every few weeks, there’s something that clogs up the roads:

a political rally where the leader talks about progress while his event literally brings the city to a standstill.

a visarjan or baraat that turns the streets into dance floors.

a festival where people set off firecrackers like they’re declaring war on the environment.

after diwali, the aqi skyrockets to 400+, and suddenly everyone’s an environmentalist on twitter — “why only question our religion?” — while they’re coughing their lungs out the next morning.

come on, the planet doesn’t care about your religion. it just knows you set off 10,000 bombs for “fun.”

why is everyone so angry all the time?

you accidentally bump into someone — boom, they’re ready to throw down. you politely ask someone to move their car — instant verbal assault.

thank goodness india doesn’t have gun laws like america. if we did, there’d be daily shootouts at every traffic light.

and the hypocrisy? off the charts.

people will spit, pee, and toss trash in public like it’s their birthright — but lose their minds if they see a woman in shorts or a couple holding hands.

they act like public decency is about controlling others, not themselves.

and don’t even get me started on the older men.

the same guys who strip down in railway waiting rooms like it’s their personal bedroom will suddenly become the moral police if a young couple buys condoms.

“sharam nahi aati?”

no uncle, the only shameful thing here is your sense of entitlement.

these are the same uncles who’ll watch item songs with their buddies but start quoting “indian culture” the moment a woman walks by in jeans.

the idea of quality of life isn’t just a fancy concept from the west — it’s a fundamental aspect of being human. it’s about having access to clean air, safe streets, and a life free from constant noise, dirt, or hostility.

it’s about living in a society where:

traffic rules are taken seriously.

police serve the community with fairness.

celebrities aren’t put on a pedestal.

festivals don’t harm the environment.

public areas are treated with the same respect as private ones.

in india, many people mistake “adjust kar lo” for resilience. but it’s not; it’s a sign of apathy. we’ve been adjusting for so long that we’ve lost sight of what it truly means to live well."
reddit,2025-10-31 15:25:29,"i am an alien in my own country. and so are my parents. what i am about to share here is something i have kept close to my chest until now. because, unfortunately, i have tried to deal with this on my own, but i have realized i am no longer capable of doing so. i have also realized that my family and i have been facing this issue for far too long and keeping silent about it isn't doing us much favor.

for all intents and purposes, i will be keeping my identity and my parents identity a secret. however, this is a story that my parents and i have experienced for quite some time.

  
i was born in hyderabad. based on what my parents mentioned later in my life, conceiving me was a decision they took after coaxing from their parents. the relation between my parents and my grandparents wasn't great. 

my grandfather favored other relatives over his own children and this caused a lot of friction between my parents and my grandparents. eventually, when my father realized he was being manipulated and coaxed into joining a business by his parents, he and my mom distanced ourselves from them.

so, for me, the only people i could depend on were my parents. because i was an introvert by nature, i couldn't foster any friendships when i was in school. even the few i had was due to group projects and homeworks. 



so, with what little resources they had, they still manage to give me the education needed to get a decent job. i graduated from regency institute of technology, yanam in 2018, when it was still open. got a bachelors degree in electrical and electronics engineering. this institute was affiliated to pondicherry university, so when the institute was closed down, my degree remained valid. 

however, keep in mind that for all this time, my parents could only afford the bare minimum and had to rely on what they had earned in their prime. so, this meant that for almost 15 years, we ended up living in urban villages like ghitorni, yanam, shaheen bagh (when i got a kpo job in noida), and so on. not to mention that we couldn't afford buying any high end equipment or house during this period.

  
in 2019, i felt like things were finally going to be better when i got selected in an off-campus drive conducted by infosys. we even opted for going to mangalore so that our expenses would stay low. 

  
nothing really changed. on the contrary, it got worse.

  
since my parents were unable to earn anything and their health condition was getting worse, i had to handle all the expenses since 2019. this meant i had to take loans and credit ever since i got my first salary. what made things worse was the pandemic where we were forced to stay in a poorly maintained 1 bhk in kaikamba for 2 years. while dad's life insurance policy matured in 2022, it only gave us a temporary respite as he only got enough to last us for a year. 

  
i have since worked in 3 projects as a systems administrator managing linux servers and cloud environments for other clients of infosys. however, the problems still remained the same on personal side of things.

  
my parent's mental health condition had also started to deteriorate as they couldn't find anyone who can understand their situation and offer a helping hand. on the contrary, everyone around us acted like we were some rich people ready to be taken advantage of. anytime my dad said, ""my son works in infosys as such and such...."" the immediate response was ""oh! so you must be earning a lakh per month at least."" or ""you must be doing quite well then.""

my starting salary when i joined as a fresher was around rs. 20k which only doubled recently, i.e., after 6 years. i couldn't shift to any other company because i was already taking  advances and loans continuously to make ends meet. not to mention my parents medical needs. 

what also infuriates me is that we have shifted to multiple states, hoping that somewhere we could get a better quality of life. despite my increase in salary and despite paying for a 1 bhk in a gated society, the water quality remained horrible. we constantly have to rely on buying bisleri, the only bottled water company in india that sells 10l and 20l water can.

i say only because any other local water company has had a worse water quality compared to bisleri. even bisleri cans differed between states. 

we couldn't afford raising a legal case or a court case against this as we just didn't have enough time or money to spend fighting this battle. plus, my father and i are already aware of how futile our justice system truly is and how little it really cares about it. if you don't have enough money to pay for a trustworthy lawyer, you will only end up paying more than what it's worth. 

ajnara le garden, one of the societies we have lived in, has a severe case of improper maintainence. this was back in 2023. due to the leakage of pipes and construction taking right next to our society, it was far from an ideal place to live in. yet, i have seen so many people just live their lives not knowing what they are actually suffering through.

  
we have taken countless measures of keeping ourselves safe. water filters, disinfectants, mosquito nets, you name it. to even avoid dealing with delivery associates who didn't follow the normal behaviour of hitting the bell once, i had to go out of my way to coordinate with him and pick the package from the lobby. just to avoid conflict. 

  
yet, none of these measures made any of our lives better. we have been trying to leave this country since the past few years. in that process, my parents have sold off the furniture and even discarded any belongings they had. whatever jewelry we had was sold off long ago. 

despite these sacrifices, i have been unable to help them move away from here. and unfortunately, i have tried asking for help but when everyone else around you are going through similar or worse situations, what can you do? i have also tried getting a freelance gig outside my area of expertise, i.e., by working on video editing jobs but all i could come across were fradulent job postings asking you to pay money just to get the job.

the most common suggestion that was given to me was ""talk to you hr!"". as someone wise once said, the hr only cares about the welfare of the company, not you! they would only be responsible if your welfare affects theirs directly. even then, i have tried. that resulted in me apologizing for asking assistance.

  
of course, when i try to ask someone else outside of my workplace, they think i am trying to scam them and begin to distance themselves away from me. 

the whole point of being in a country and having a community is that we share our burden. our issues. if we no longer do that, then what are we? my father used to share tales of his great grandfather having a great life with just a few anna's. nowadays, you cannot manage a week without rs. 10000. rs. 5000 if you're living in the suburbs.

  
i want to keep fighting and trying to get my parents to a better place where they can live the rest of their lives peacefully without facing the hassles they are going through now. i am prepared to sacrifice my life should that opportunity arise. but that is unfortunately not the case.  i have, indeed, become an alien in my own country because the people around me have turned a blind eye against what we face in our daily lives. and despite everything, i cannot find the opportunities that would help me escape this abyss. at least, that's how i feel. i'd like to know if any of you have gone through what i or my parents have gone through. it would also be helpful if you could tell me how you got out of your own abyss."

* i always dispose of my waste at the designated spot( at front door) they told us to use.
* i don’t even have an operational kitchen, so the vegetable waste they found couldn’t be mine.

but the frustrating part ,that person refused to open the gate or talk to them. despite that, they fined **me only instead**, saying “if one person does it, everyone in the building must pay,"" not even bothering to even talk to families that might it belongs to. they also took my photo, and now i’m really worried about my image being tarnished on social media if they post when i didn’t do anything wrong.

has anyone dealt with a similar situation? is there a way to **contest the fine or complain** about this unfair treatment? any suggestions on how to prevent this from happening again would be really appreciated."

for the sake of discussion can we ignore negatives and channel all our discussions on what we should solve for?

i worked in tech for 15 years and having gone through lots of job loss waves made me think why we solve our own problems than be beggars for job outside. having lived abroad for years also make me think migration is not the solution for problems. 

i am from punjab and there are few funamental challenges that i think tech can solve

\- farming and customers are still not connected directly, i see local farmers try to sell on own they are successful, but largely the connection is missing.

\- aimless degree selling business in higher education with no link to practical problems, how to build a culture where students become enterpreuners than job seekers

\- having got taste of sharemarket and trading, i think we can learn a lot from gujrat. everyone from that state participates in share market and generates wealth for themselves. we in punjab do not use tech to do that

\- use of rain water harvesting and ponds to recharge water problems of punjab. most of my state has almost no drinking water left or whatever is left is containing heavy metals.

\- is there any tech that can help with controlling floods? we got lot of damage recently, can concrete walls help in that case?"

reddit,2025-11-03 22:13:15,"tired of complaining how broken our cities are every day i scroll through the news and it’s the same thing. accidents, rapes, murders, broken roads, garbage, people living in horrible conditions. it’s like there’s no end to how bad things can get here. it honestly messes with my head sometimes.

the stress of daily life is constant. pollution, dust, noise, traffic, unplanned construction. nothing feels easy. i feel powerless most days.

i did my undergrad in sydney and that was the first time i saw how a city can actually work. you don’t need a car. public transport just works. there are parks, plazas, beaches, markets that are clean and safe. people follow rules. public spaces are respected. it all felt so natural.

but still, i came back. because sydney never felt like home. i missed the food, the people, the chaos, the culture. i missed that sense of belonging. but when i came back, reality hit hard.

the roads, the trash, the corruption, the disregard for rules, it all just gets to you. i kept ranting about it to anyone who’d listen. and every single time, i’d get the same line.

“yeh india hai, yaha sab chalta hai”

and maybe they’re right. anyone can complain. but if you really care, you should do something. that line has been stuck in my head for a while.

i’ve been lucky. i don’t have to worry about money before making most decisions. i know that’s a privilege. and i think i owe it to myself to use it for something that matters.

i love jaipur. i love its history, the architecture, the food, the energy. but i want it to be more. i want it to be a city people are proud of. clean air, proper drainage, working public transport, walkable roads, functioning infrastructure. basic things that shouldn’t feel like a luxury.

for years i’ve been voting but never for someone i actually look up to. always the least worst option. i’m tired of waiting for a young leader to show up and speak our language. so i’ve decided to at least try to be that voice myself.

i’m an introvert and i know this will take time. i’m thinking of starting small, probably here on reddit, maybe later on youtube or wherever people my age actually listen. just starting conversations about the issues that matter and what we can actually do.

if things go well, my long term goal is to run for mla from malviya nagar in 2028. i don’t know if it’ll work out, maybe it won’t. but i’d rather try than spend my whole life regretting that i never did anything.

i’ll stay anonymous for now. even my family laughs at the idea of me doing something like this. but hopefully over time i’ll grow a thicker skin.

i just needed to write this somewhere. it’s been sitting heavy on me for almost a year now. i feel a bit lighter after typing it all out.

if you’ve read till here, thank you. i’m sure some of you feel the same way. tired, frustrated, angry, but still in love with this place. i don’t know if we can change everything, but maybe we can start somewhere."

yesterday, i took it out for a regular drive to the office. my usual route includes outer ring road (hsr–marathahalli), brookfield, and sometimes varthur. and of course, while passing through varthur, i hit one of those massive craters they call potholes. right after that, my car started making strange noises. turns out, the exhaust pipe got damaged.

so, back to the service center again and now they’re saying it’ll cost me another 5k to fix. honestly, i’m so fed up with this nonsense. i’ve already spent so much just to keep my car running, and all it takes is one pathetic stretch of road to ruin everything.

at this point, i’d rather just pay someone directly to fill and tar the potholes on my daily route instead of paying road tax to a government that clearly doesn’t care.

reddit,2025-11-06 19:44:03,"the coerced electricity tax on chennai vaasis: ups, batteries, inverters, and stabilizers becoming  everybody expense there’s an unspoken tax every chennaiite pays—not printed on a bill, not legislated by the state, yet unavoidable. it’s the tax of survival in a city where electricity reliability has collapsed under tneb’s monopoly. every citizen is now a reluctant participant in a silent infrastructure project that exists only because the tamil nadu electricity board has failed to deliver the stability it’s supposed to guarantee.

what used to be public responsibility is now a private burden. homes that once needed only a simple plug point now resemble power management rooms. there are ups units tucked under tables, inverters stacked in corners, stabilizers lined up behind almost every appliance, and separate ups units keeping wi‑fi routers alive through outages. residential space, already scarce in chennai’s dense apartments, is now sacrificed to store bulky batteries and service gear that shouldn’t even be necessary.

the financial load is staggering. families spend anywhere between ₹15,000 and ₹60,000 on this makeshift ecosystem—then pay for maintenance every year: topping battery water, replacing dead cells, rewiring burned sockets, and booking technician visits that add both direct cost and wasted time. every few years, the replacement cycle begins again. delivery charges for batteries, wall reinforcements for inverters, and transportation costs pile up quietly into a parallel economy built on voltage instability.

and the absurdity doesn’t end there. the very power fluctuations that destroy appliances also damage the backup gear meant to protect them, creating a self‑fueling loop of expense. these devices were conceived as solutions for emergencies, yet under tneb’s neglect, they’ve become mandatory equipment for every home—from low‑income tenants to it professionals. the city’s residents are essentially running a personal energy ecosystem under the nose of a state monopoly.

tneb, meanwhile, continues to operate unchecked. complaints about erratic voltage, sudden outages during peak heat, or unplanned maintenance blackouts rarely see quick resolution. the organization still dictates supply, pricing, and service quality—without competition, incentive, or accountability. citizens shoulder the cost while the board remains insulated from consequence.

chennai’s collective energy spend now includes two layers: the official tariff paid to tneb and the silent, coerced tax of backup infrastructure—paid in cash, square footage, maintenance fatigue, and lost trust.

this system has persisted so long that it’s become invisible. yet it’s time we ask a fundamental question:

is tneb’s monopoly on power distribution truly in the public interest, or has it evolved into a state‑sanctioned stranglehold that forces every chennai vaasi to pay for self‑sufficiency within their own homes?

reddit,2025-11-08 14:04:15,"lack of road milling (removing top layer) before laying new roads, and how politicians are keeping roads bad on purpose to award more contracts and make money in most cities like chennai, hyderabad i’ve seen main roads and even smaller roads being milled (removal of top layer of tar) before new roads are laid. this is something that i’ve never seen being done in bangalore.

due to this every time a new road is laid down the road gains around 5-6 inches in height. within 3-4 years the road almost reaches the same height as the footpath. bbmp gives out contracts to increase the height of footpaths, which leads to demolition of the entire concrete footpath structure and its built again at huge costs. this cycle follows every few years from what i’ve noticed near my house. 

on my main road (uttarahalli kengeri main road), just 5 months ago they constructed new footpaths and drains and laid down new roads which were of poor quality as they developed potholes within a few weeks, last week they laid down  new roads without milling the old one and the footpaths are just 3-4 inches higher  than the road now, there is lack of openings for the rain water and all the water just flood the road or flows down the road leading to more potholes. 

when we first built our house 12 years ago, our entrance was almost 3ft above the road level, now it’s almost 3-4 inches below the road level and all the rain water gushes in during monsoon. just this month they gave out new contracts to raise the level of all the footpaths in my area, they raised the height by just a few inches despite objections and from  the looks of it the next time they lay a new road it will be back in level with the footpath. 

they hadn’t placed openings for rain water draining and had sealed the entire road with no way for the rainwater to enter the drains. we had to fight with them and create a ruckus for them to come back and dig the drain holes, they didn’t place any mesh either so we bought metal meshes on our own and gave it to them to place near the drains to prevent waste from entering it. 

all this is being done on purpose. laying good quality roads that last years = no new contracts for footpaths, drain cleaning, pothole fixes or new roads. bangalore roads are being kept bad on purpose as a means to give out more contracts and make more money. 

these are contracts of lower amounts that doesn’t raise eyebrows like bigger scams that involve thousands of crores. but these small contracts a constant source of bribes, money (contractors are in most cases relatives or friends of politicians) and when we take the entire city in into consideration it generates huge amounts of bribes for the mla’s and councillors."

and the people sitting there? won’t move an inch unless you slip a crisp note into their pocket.

then, to get the ec, you need to go to the sub-registrar office for your area. again, place another note in someone’s hand to get the certificate.

after all this, you take every single one of those papers and go to bengaluru one to apply for e-khata, where they demand a ₹200 “fee” to “freely” apply for e-khata.

honestly, i don’t even know how useful this e-khata thing is or what it’s really for, but seriously — what the fuck was all this about?

it took me four whole working days to get this nonsense done. i had to deal with a bunch of low-life imbeciles just to get my work processed, and ended up paying over ₹10,000 in bribes across all properties.

reddit,2025-11-09 10:45:20,"physically felt pollution when entering delhi  (nov 09, 2025) monday early morning i was coming from ambala where i had gone for a couple of days. 

i can say that i have literally physically felt the effect of pollution while entering delhi (entered from singhu border side). most people living in delhi don't feel ""the punch"" as they are accustomed to it.

on nearing the bhalswa garbage mountain - yes it's very much there and has grown huge - i suddenly felt the strong unmistakable smell of burning (garbage/pollution?) - yes the massive garbage dump keeps on burning at many places!

after that all the real effects on the body started; 

1. burning sensation in the eyes to the point that water came out and i couldn't keep them open- obvious driving hazard. i had to use a wet handkerchief and wipe the eyes - to little effect

2. burning sensation in the throat and tip of the tongue. the body created mucus to conteract the foreign particles entering inside. i immediately felt that i had a throat infection or sore throat .

3. thoughts became cloudy and less clearer

possible reasons: 

on the way along the road itself, i could see a number of places where stubble/ parali is being burnt openly and blatantly in the fields by the farmers. 

in addition, there were a number of places along the road with random fires that were spewing toxic black smoke in the air including in residential areas - there was a massive fire in rohini yesterday. 

many factories/brick kilns work unhindered during the night- emitting thick smoke into the air

guys, pollution is  very real and serious here. it is really impacting the body physically in unknown ways. nobody knows what impact the particulate matter particles pm10, 2.5 (and smaller) have on the body in long term or short term. 

you cannot ignore the pollution or wish it away. 

my advise is, if you can, ditch delhi ncr altogether- there's nothing more important than your health. even if you earn less, try to relocate to a healthier place. 

try to be away from here as much as possible - even places like ambala feel better in comparison. 

use the best and biggest air purifiers that you can afford and use them day and night in home, in car in office- everywhere."

i’ve especially noticed that after covid, many individuals appear more irritable and on edge. meanwhile, the government tends to silence criticism rather than enforce strong actions against wrongdoers. in many cases, those responsible for serious offences seem to have political connections, which allows them to escape accountability.

potholes claim lives, train accidents occur far too often, yet meaningful action is rare. it’s disheartening to see these problems persist without substantial solutions.

victims of terror attacks haven't got any justice. those terrorist who killed 26 people in pahalgam still roaming freely.

those who were responsible for the crash of ai-171 still haven't been charged or hold responsible.

reddit,2025-11-20 09:59:12,"haven't seen such an idiotic garbage collection system anywhere recently moved to bangalore and apart from the traffic and the exorbitant rents, poor garbage collection system has stood out as the city's highlight.

i am someone who works normal hours plus have meetings in the us time. but the garbage collection has made sure i don't get proper sleep.
 
i tried waking up in the morning 6:30 for a week even after my calls till 3 am - and tracking the truck times but the great bbmp guys seem to have their own schedule.

some days they'll come before 6:30, then 7 and some days it's post 10.

not to add if you're living away from the roadside there's nothing you can do except going and checking downstairs every time there's a truck sound. coming from the north where the trucks have fixed timings and some sirens on them, having to face this in a city like bangalore is crazy.

fixed timings, community bins, sirens on the trucks are the basic things that can be done to make things easier but i guess the city works different. 

never understood why there's so much litter and garbage thrown around that too nearby big tech parks. i guess we have the reason now."
reddit,2025-11-21 15:12:47,"whom to contact if garbage marshal acts like garbage ? i have raised several complaints about the garbage situation in my area, but it seems the marshal is not taking the issue seriously and is closing the cases without resolving them. i’m not sure whom to contact next as there is no clear way to reach higher officials. it’s extremely frustrating to feel helpless, especially when basic responsibilities that officials are paid to handle are being neglected.

it’s disheartening to see attention being given to large projects while essential civic issues remain unresolved. why is there no accountability? how did we end up in a situation where citizens have to struggle so much just to get basic services?"

straight to the point:
my dad lost his job in chandigarh, came back to kerala, and grabbed a petrol pump job just to survive. it’s been 3–4 months and the place is basically daylight robbery.

they pay him ₹11,000/month, and every month they randomly cut ₹1k–₹2k saying the “cash doesn’t match.” it’s obvious they’re dumping their accounting mess on the staff. total scam behavior.

he’s done with this.
he doesn’t need some fancy corporate role — he just wants a normal job that pays better than this garbage and doesn’t screw him over.

here’s where he stands:

english: not great

hindi: solid

past experience: cng operator, but tech’s outdated now

goal: any stable job with better pay than this petrol pump nonsense


if anyone knows realistic options — factories, warehouse work, security jobs, cng/lpg stations, courier/logistics, whatever — drop them. i’m not looking for motivational fluff, just genuine leads or directions."

reddit,2025-11-23 19:18:47,"my foreign friends experienced rural indian hospitality and it left them genuinely astonished so i did my ms in the west, made a bunch of great friends there, and once in a while they visit india. but like most foreigners, they stick to the big cities, monuments, tourist magnets, instagram places, you know the drill.

this time i told them:

&gt; “bro, keep taj mahal aside. i’m taking you to real india.”


so me, a few local buddies, and my foreign friends rented a traveller and went on a road trip straight into rural india, my home turf. i wanted to show them the actual heartbeat of the country: villages, farms, tiny temples, little gems that many people doesn’t even know exist.

they were already surprised just seeing how connected village people are

when i took them to my own village, they were absolutely stunned that i knew literally every person by name and their father’s nameand sometimes their grandfather’s name.

everywhere we went it was like:

&gt; “oh this is so-and-so’s son, whose father is so-and-so…”



my friends were confused like:

&gt; “how do you people remember this?!”



then came the bad event, our traveller broke down at dusk

mechanic came, tried his best, but nope. it was getting dark. no hotels. proper rural area. options were:

1. sleep in the traveller
2. or somehow find shelter

then my village instincts activated. 

my mom told me there’s a woman from our village living in the next village with her husband. so me and a friend started walking there, asking around for her by name.

classic village style:

&gt; “do you know x’s daughter who married y from this village?”


and somehow, within a few minutes, we reached her house.

we explained the situation to her husband. without a single question he said:

&gt; “stay here tonight.”


then we told him the real number:

&gt; “uh… there are 12 of us.”


he didn’t even blink.
he instantly called neighbours, friends and within 5 minutes they arranged sleeping space, bedding, and food for all 12 of us.

no charge.
no formalities.
no hesitation.
just pure humanity.

and here’s the best part:
they didn’t even know yet that some of us were foreigners.

when they saw the foreigners… party mode on 😂

suddenly everyone came with chai, snacks, dinner, stories, jokes — it turned into a mini village festival. people kept saying:

&gt; “guest is god.” (“athithi devo bhava” )


my foreign friends were floored. they were shocked with the hospitality we received.

one literally said:

&gt; “in the west, not even your neighbour will let you stay in their house, forget a complete stranger.”


honestly, this is just normal village culture for us

growing up, i’ve slept at my friends’ houses so many times. i would fall asleep while playing, and instead of waking me up, they’d cover me with a bedsheet and put me on a proper bed. my parents never panicked, they knew i was safe because everyone in the village looks after each other.

during weddings, guests stayed at random houses. no need to book hotels, you just find someone from your village, district, or even the same state, and boom you're family.

my grandfather was legendary at this. he had a crazy good memory and would make connections instantly:

&gt; “this person is related to that person who knows that person from the neighbouring village.”


because of him, we built friendships everywhere. and whenever a problem came up, someone always helped because of those village connections.

my foreign friends said it was the most heartwarming experience of their lives.

and i honestly felt proud."
reddit,2025-11-23 20:06:31,"road fixed in whitefield hi everyone,

just wanted to share some positive news. i recently came across a video of prateek singh on youtube where he mentioned about the swatchhata app where we can report issue on that.

i was skeptical at first thinking that the issues reported that would go unresolved, much like every time this has happened.

yet i still downloaded the app and tried it out, reporting a bad stretch of road in whitefield (3rd a cross road near bagmane solarium city chinnapannahlli)

the road was horrible with two/three potholes that were so deep i was sure it was a major accident waiting to happen all it took was one misjudged overtake or bad luck to fall into the pothole.

and i too was frustrated with how the roads in bangalore were and was thinking things would never improve even though i have complained.

but i was shocked to notice a week later the job had been completed and that it was not a shabby job. manhole covers were placed in the right spots and were smooth and unobtrusive.

even though the status of the job was mentioned ""on the job"", the work had been completed and i was very happy to see action taken and the road fixed.

the point of this post was not to blow my own trumpet, but to urge people to use the app to make atleast the roads of banglore safe.

of course i also realized that it could have been pure coincidence that the work was already scheduled before and i just complained at the right time.

but i have raised another complaint about an open footpath that leads to a drain and will check if this work too happens according to plan.

doing this small part has lightened my mood, and although the app i a little buggy and raising the complaint might not work every time (due to some bug) i would say it is worth spending few minutes in raising an complaint.

also i am no way involved with the app or it's creation but just found this helpful to get our voices heard.

tl;dr:

swatchhata app works and potholes on road were fixed within a week.

and yeah we've seen that cow dung festival from india go viral. be honest, how many indians even knew about this? it's probably practiced by 50 people in country of 1.3b and yet we're all identified by that. now there is a cow chip throwing festival in oklahoma, usa where they lick their fingers between each throw. there is a sheep dung spitting festival in europe where they literally take sheep dung into their mouths and spit it. i've never seen indians humiliate white people by making an entire documentary about this and inviting world hate. in 1858, the river thames was so disgusting because people threw all their waste including feces into the water and londoners used the same water for cleaning and drinking. it was so bad that it even got its own name, the great stink of 1858. but i haven't seen indians humiliate brits with this like how they keep reiterating about sati practice in medieval india or cow dung usage.

i'm not defending india by any means, i know we have problems and we need to work on it, but its only the negatives from india that goes viral. this only tells me about the amount of hate they hold for india. anything positive is dismissed as fake or they forcefully hate on it.

all of this has started affecting how i feel about traveling and socializing. i love learning about other cultures, but i worry about being judged or shut out because i’m indian. i’m trying hard not to generalize entire groups based on the actions of a few, whether it’s westerners, muslims, chinese, or anyone else. it’s a constant internal battle.

but i get where all this is coming from. indians are at fault too. the stupid bootlicking of you know who, not treating foreign female travelers to india well, taking pictures with them without consent, poor hygiene, stalking, catcalling etc. yes there are india haters who travel to india just to capture only the shittier parts but they're not that many tbh. more visit real places. and lets not forget, indians are racist too, to black people, to chinese and even to our citizens. south indians will hate on north and vice versa. i don't want to get into that because it's very depressing.

* has **voice alerts** while traveling
* lets users post issues (e.g., product problem, scam, safety incident)
* community can comment/help/guide

income tax notice scam: everything is filed via a registered chartered accountant company but still you get a legal notice. irrespective of how many clarifications you submit, even via a lawyer they ask you to physically come and visit. then you send your ca who knows the ins and outs and settles it for a bribe amount then you get a immunity letter for the year.

electricity board scam 1: you apply for a temporary connection during construction but they wont give you a meter and give you some excuse that it is just temporary, there is a shortage of meters etc., and then at the end the same person will fine you in lacks for electricity theft. then you have to volanturily offer a bribe and then they will close the notice but this is just a beginning. this was just a filter scam to filter out any victims who are politically connected or violent. if you settle with bribe that means you are not politically connected or violent but a docile person who can be extorted. now you are in their list and they will come back after a year or two with another scam.

electricity board scam 2: they will want to install the infamous adani/esim emeter which is known to rake up your bills sometimes to 10s of thousands and sometimes in lakhs. it is not mandatory btw but the guy on the phone will use threatening tone, show some new paper clippings (he gets paid per meter, he is an agent, so he will say whatever to make money) and if you resist and deny instead of paying him off (because you are in the docile victim list) then you will get a bill in lakhs with an accusation for stealing electricity. apparently the agent came in the house, counted all the elctric items in the house and he made his own calculation and accused them of electricity theft and added all of that to his next month electricity bill. now if he doesnt pay the electricity bill in lakhs, he will get a power cut. he can go to court which will take forever but untill then he wont have electricity for his house. now he has to cough up more bribe to end this extortion."

reddit,2025-12-01 23:36:59,"why india fails in urban governance, we don’t have cities like new york, london, singapore 
i’ve been digging into how indian cities are actually run, and honestly, the whole structure feels designed to fail. we keep wondering why we don’t have cities like new york, london, or singapore, but the answer is pretty simple: our urban governance model is completely broken.

here’s the reality most people don’t know:


the mayor basically has no power

in almost every indian city, the mayor is mostly a ceremonial role. they cut ribbons, attend events, chair meetings… and that’s about it.

they can’t:

control police

hire or fire municipal staff

issue work orders

approve big projects

run transport

manage planning

take decisions on infrastructure


most mayors don’t even get a proper term some states give them just 1 year. what can anyone change in one year?


the real power sits with the municipal commissioner

this is the part that shocked me.

the person who actually runs the city is an ias officer appointed by the state government, not by the people.

commissioners hold almost every executive power:

budget execution

staff control

contracts/tenders

water, sewage, sanitation

roads and infrastructure

building approvals

daily operations

disaster management


so the elected mayor has to depend on an appointed bureaucrat for every single action. this is the opposite of cities that actually function well.


 law &amp; order? completely with the state

mayors in india have zero role in policing.
traffic police, crime, riot control — everything is run by the state home department and police commissioner.

compare this with:

nyc: mayor controls nypd

london: mayor sets policing priorities

singapore: unified city-state structure


in india, the mayor doesn’t even have a say.


city functions are split across too many agencies

this part makes development painfully slow.

a typical indian city has:

metro controlled by a state agency

planning by dda/mmrda/bda (state controlled)

bus transport by separate corporations

police by state

water, sewage, garbage by different departments 

electricity by state boards/discoms

housing by state housing boards


there is no single point of accountability.

in nyc, london, singapore — the city leadership controls or coordinates most of this under one roof.


 states don’t want powerful mayors

let’s be honest.
a strong mayor with a 5-year term becomes a political heavyweight.

state governments prefer:

short mayor terms

weak mayor powers

commissioners who report to them

fragmented agencies that can’t unite


this keeps urban power with the state, but at the cost of city development.




so how do global cities do it?

look at new york:

mayor runs a $100b+ budget

controls nypd, fire, schools, sanitation

appoints heads of all major departments

sets development and transport policy

has a stable 4-year term


london and singapore follow similar strong-mayor or unified models.

india is one of the few countries where the mayor is more like a figurehead than a real executive.


the result: slow, chaotic, uncoordinated cities

our cities don’t lack talent, money, or ambition.
they lack governance that makes someone clearly responsible.

unless we fix

weak mayors

overpowered commissioners

fragmented agencies

zero control over law/order

lack of financial autonomy


we’ll keep repeating the same question:
“why can’t indian cities be like new york or singapore?”

because the system doesn’t allow them to."

reddit,2025-12-03 22:44:01,"the lingering shadow of bhopal gas tragedy 3 december 2025 marks the forty-first anniversary of the massive toxic gas leak from union carbide corporation's chemical plant in bhopal in the state of madhya pradesh, india, that killed more than 3,800 people. over time, it’s estimated that more than 22,000 people died from mic exposure and more than half a million were maimed for life. survivors have faced chronic health issues, three generations of birth defects, economic consequences, and ongoing groundwater contamination from unsafe disposal of poisonous wastes at the pesticide plant.

in 1969, the union carbide india limited (ucil) started its operation at the bhopal plant to produce the pesticide sevin.  the plant was initially approved only for the formulation of pesticides, using imported intermediates, including methyl isocyanate (mic). however, the plant began manufacturing the intermediate chemical methyl isocyanate (mic) on-site in 1979 as part of a ""backward integration"" strategy to lower costs and reduce import dependency. 

local managers were directed to close the plant and prepare it for sale in july 1984. when no ready buyer was found, ucil made plans to dismantle key production units of the facility for shipment to another developing country. in the meantime, the facility continued to operate with safety equipment and procedures far below the standards found in its sister plant in institute, west virginia. the local government was aware of safety problems, but was reticent to place heavy industrial safety and pollution control.

at 11:00 pm on december 2, 1984, an operator at a bhopal plant noticed a small leak of methyl isocyanate (mic) gas and rising pressure in a storage tank. a safety scrubber had been turned off weeks earlier, and a faulty valve allowed one ton of water to mix with forty tons of mic. additionally, a refrigeration unit meant to cool the tank was drained of coolant, and the gas flare safety system had been out of order for three months. at around 1:00 am on december 3, a safety valve failed, releasing a plume of mic gas into the air. within hours, bhopal's streets were filled with human and animal corpses.

hamidia hospital, bhopal’s largest and closest to the disaster site, was flooded with people experiencing blindness and injuries to their airways and lungs. many of the deaths were a result of pulmonary edema, a condition in which fluid accumulates in the lungs and can cause respiratory failure. this fluid buildup resulted from an inflammatory response that was triggered by exposure to high levels of mic.

estimates suggest that up to 10,000 people may have died in the initial days due to the ucc plant plume, with 15,000 to 20,000 additional premature deaths over the next two decades. the indian government reported that over half a million people were exposed to the gas, and several studies indicated increased morbidity and mortality in the affected population.

researchers from the university of california (uc) conducted a comprehensive analysis to assess the long-term health consequences and potential intergenerational effects of the bhopal gas tragedy. they gathered data from the national family health survey (nfhs-4) conducted between 2015 and 2016 and the integrated public use microdata series from india for the year 1999, including individuals ranging from ages six to 64 years and those in utero at the time of the disaster.

* women who were pregnant with male fetuses and resided within 100 km of bhopal had a one percentage point higher disability rate that affected their employment 15 years later.
* there was a decline in the proportion of male births from 64% (1981-1984) to 60% (1985) among mothers living within 100 km of bhopal suggesting a higher vulnerability of male fetuses to external stress.
* men born in 1985 within 100 km of bhopal had an eightfold higher risk of cancer compared to those born in the periods 1976-1984 and 1986-1990.
* furthermore, men born in 1985 who continued to reside within 100 km of bhopal experienced a 27-fold higher risk of cancer in 2015 compared to their counterparts born in the reference periods and individuals living more than 100 km away.
* those who were in utero during the tragedy and lived within 100 km of bhopal were one percentage point more likely to report employment disability compared to older individuals and those residing further from bhopal.

the site was never properly cleaned, resulting in toxic waste seeping into the groundwater and contaminating wells for decades. chloroform concentrations were found to be as much as 3.5 times higher than the established drinking water guidelines. carbon tetrachloride levels also reached up to 2,400 times above these guidelines.

the world moved on. the corporation escaped. but in bhopal, the poison is in the soil, in the water, and in the bodies of a third generation.

we are installing a 3.5 kw on-grid rooftop solar system at our home in bangalore under bescom net-metering.our installer is not giving a clear explanation on how the exported units are actually settled in the electricity bill and not explaining how exactly net metering reflects in the electricity bills, so i want to understand it from real users who already have net-metering running from bescom. 

i would really appreciate help on these questions:

1. are the exported units kept as unit (kwh) credit and directly subtracted from future imported units, or are they converted into money first (for example ₹2.97 per unit or some other rate)?
for example: if in one month we export 400 units and next month we consume 500 units, will bescom simply bill us for the net 100 units, or do they convert 400 units into money first and then apply it?

2. do unused exported units carry forward month-to-month, so that they continue reducing future bills?

3. what happens at the end of the year to remaining surplus export units?
are they reset, carried forward, or converted into rupees and paid out?

4. can anyone share a recent bescom electricity bill screenshot (with personal details blurred) showing the format where import/export/net settlement appears?
this will help me understand exactly how the billing line items look.

reddit,2025-12-06 16:06:31,"ayurveda &amp; homoeopathy are shit and india is paying the price hi, i am a mbbs student in medical college. i am writing this post to make people aware of certain things, because most people don’t know about them.
please read this fully so that my efforts won’t be wasted. you may find it shocking at first, but please bear with me till the end. thank you.

let’s start by defining “doctor” in india. unlike other developed countries, india doesn’t have a simple definition of a doctor. in india, you will find four types of doctors:

type 1
mbbs (so-called allopathy / modern medicine)

type 2
bams (ayurveda)

type 3
bhms (homeopathy)

type 4
“jhad-phook” practitioners

now let’s see what happens in developed, developed nations.
they have only one kind of doctor a doctor who works on the principles of science ""modern medicine"" please remember this term “modern medicine”, as i will use it often later.

most of you have already taken ayurvedic medicines like chyawanprash, etc., or “meethi goli” as part of homeopathic treatment, right?
now i am going to challenge these systems, because they are based on pseudoscience and do not have proper scientific backing or evidence.

we now live in an era where everything must be proved by science and should give reproducible results in clinical trials. there is something called evidence-based medicine. so let’s apply that standard to ayurveda and homeopathy, because modern medicine (also called allopathy / evidence-based medicine) already has enormous clinical trials conducted all over the world and is still improving every day.

#why is homeopathy a pseudoscience?

homeopathy, a practice relying on extreme dilution where often not a single molecule of the original substance remains, lacks a biologically plausible mechanism of action and is firmly rooted in 18th-century beliefs rather than modern science. claims of ""water memory"" are rejected by chemistry and physics due to a complete lack of proof. when subjected to high-quality clinical trials, homeopathy consistently fails to show any effect beyond that of a placebo, and its results cannot be consistently replicated. multiple meta-analyses confirm this lack of efficacy, noting that positive findings typically originate from poor-quality or biased studies. consequently, major health bodies in countries like the uk, australia, and the usa have rejected it as effective medicine, warning that its use can dangerously delay real treatment, potentially causing serious health damage.

you can read these research articles if you have time, or show them to a relative or friend who doesn’t accept scientific facts:

https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1478

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15894089/

now i think we are on common ground regarding homeopathy being pseudoscience. if you still don’t believe me, you can google or search it on chatgpt. now let’s move on to ayurveda.

this is the harder part, because national pride is involved in ayurveda, as it originated in ancient india. many people think, “old is gold” and believe that people used to live for 200–300 years in ancient times due to ayurveda. this is simply not true.

this research paper shows that in ancient times, due to lack of effective medicine, the average human life expectancy barely crossed 50 years:

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/pmc2868286

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/pmc8185965

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/pmc6060866

#why ayurveda is not evidence-based:

1. no biological basis, concepts like vata, pitta and kapha have no proven physiological or biochemical correlation.
2. not falsifiable, ayurvedic explanations can’t be objectively tested or disproved in a lab (which is a basic requirement of science).
3. weak clinical evidence, most ayurvedic treatments lack large, well-designed randomized controlled trials (rcts).
4. poor-quality studies , many studies have small sample sizes, no blinding and poor methodology.
5. heavy metal toxicity, many ayurvedic medicines contain lead, mercury and arsenic at toxic levels.
6. inconsistent results, the same treatment gives different outcomes in different studies (no reproducibility).
7. relies on tradition, not evidence,claims are based on ancient texts rather than modern validation.
8. no standardisation ,the same “medicine” varies in quality, dose and composition between manufacturers.
9. mostly anecdote-based ,supported mainly by personal stories, not scientific data.
10. not accepted in modern treatment guidelines as a primary therapy.

now to be fare ayurveda is not entirely useless. since it uses natural ingredients, it can have some mild effects on the body. but instead of consuming products like chyawanprash, it is better to consume fresh fruits like amla. this will benefit you without exposing you to toxic heavy metals.

now let’s look at the most dangerous part.

what happens when ayurvedic quacks prescribe antibiotics?

many bams doctors do not prescribe traditional ayurvedic medicines. instead, they give antibiotics, steroids, and painkillers in small powder packets (“pudiya”), without informing the patient.

let’s say a person named raju has fever and cold. he goes to a bams “doctor,” who gives him a few packets. after taking them, his fever goes away. he thinks, “wow, such a great doctor.”
but what he doesn’t realise is that this uncontrolled antibiotic use is creating antibiotic resistance in his body and in the population.
later, when he develops a serious infection, even strong antibiotics might not work.

according to reports, india is heading towards an antibiotic resistance crisis:
https://www.ndtv.com/health/india-at-the-epicentre-of-superbug-explosion-antibiotic-resistance-crisis-new-lancet-study-9655603

this means in future, common infections could become untreatable.

(please go through this comment)

now let me give a few reasons for that, as i have enough ground-level experience with all kinds of doctors (as i mentioned in my original post).

in rural areas, we have so many bams quacks sitting there and prescribing loads of antibiotics, steroids, and painkillers just to reduce symptoms, which is illegal in all states of india except maharashtra. apparently, this is because we don’t have enough scientific temperament in the government.
now how do they do that? they know that ayurvedic treatment is limited and won’t help immediately, especially in severe cases. so they give antibiotics and painkillers without actually knowing how they work and just reduce the symptoms without treating the cause.

how can they do this so openly? they bribe the cmo.
that’s it that’s the one-line answer.

modern medicine doctors also prescribe antibiotics like candy. now, what i have understood from my field experience and from what i’ve seen in patients (i see thousands of patients daily in my college hospital and outside) is this:
in a case where a bams quack gives loads of antibiotics, the symptoms may go away immediately. meanwhile, an mbbs doctor who is trying to work on the actual disease may take time to diagnose it properly and then give appropriate treatment instead of just working on the “symptoms,” which is why they ask for diagnostic tests.

but for a patient, all this is very time-consuming and costly, and i completely agree with them. so most people, who are unaware of these things, go to the bams guy. by understanding this, we know that if this continues in the long term, an mbbs doctor won’t be able to earn and sustain a life in this country where everything is unregulated, right?

so please read this carefully when i say the following:
even mbbs doctors have started going for symptom-based medication because of the crowd, and this has resulted in a huge amount of unnecessary antibiotic use, which has led to antibiotic resistance.

how can we solve this?
simply by sharing posts like this and increasing scientific temperament among people, at least.


why do these practitioners attract a large crowd?
because they give quick relief by using strong medicines like steroids, antibiotics and painkillers. symptoms disappear fast, so people think the treatment is excellent, without understanding the long-term damage.

“doctors are looters. they write unnecessary tests.”
yes, not all doctors are good. but in about 90% of cases, tests are written for genuine reasons.

for example:
you have fever and a skin rash.
a quack gives you medicine, symptoms go away, but the actual disease might still be present.
a qualified doctor orders tests to rule out dangerous causes. if the tests come normal, don’t say, “why did he make me do tests for nothing?” that test may have ruled out a deadly disease and possibly saved your life.

please understand the importance of diagnostic tests.

[this part is extra , read this if you beleive in ayurveda so much]

i have no problem in people using ayurveda for the treatment but as i explained to so many other people let me explain the same thing here again .i assume that you read my post completely.
let's address this 

why did i say ayurveda is shit?

because it uses old principles not relevant in the modern age , i am not saying they are not effective but they just don't make sense because modern medicine (which we call allopathy in india) has already acquired the useful part of ayurveda

but people can still use it is it their choice ?? right ?
yes i totally agree with you here but it must be regulated highly by the alternative medicine authority of the government which is ayush here in india.

what do i mean by ""highly regulated""
ayurveda vaidya must use ayurvedic treatment only and not try to 'integrate' itself in modern methods by prescribing antibiotics 

why ?? they can prescribe why they shouldn't blend with modern medicine? 
it is because they don't know how antibiotics and modern medicine work that's it , they are free to use their method but practicing modern medicine without any knowledge leads to serious consequences which i talked about in my original post 

what should be done then ?
the government should regulate these alternative medicines tightly they should only be allowed to treat patients in a few minor cases only not all cases with their traditional natural methods.

why not all methods ?? 
it's because when serious cases go to ayurveda it actually gets worse and when nothing works they come back to modern medicine when it gets worse. let me give you an example someone with a tibia fracture went to ayurveda quack and he gave them some jadi booti now this can lead to serious infection and possibly other major complexions. 

but again it's their choice na ?
the problem with india is education we don't know what's the best thing for us , for now the government needs to promote scientific evidence based medicine not something which is totally based on belief, common people don't know how things work as everyone claims to be scientific.



now lets address [some issues i found online]
for modern medicine , i think yes most of drugs have side effects but proven scientifically to work and cure 
yeah i agree if someone wants they can go to natural treatments for minor discomfort 

we live in a capitalist state i guess if we want healthcare to be free / cheap we need major reforms in our government 

for most of the tier 3 , tier 4 and village areas of india there are no doctors and these quacks handle every patient. they prescribe medicine like candy even for minor issues where they aren't required and obviously patients get treated well 
if you don't give medicine to patients , he/she thinks (specially in rural areas) that doctor is bad he didn't have any meds means he don't know the disease.

now why modern medicine doctors  started copying quackery?
because of the same , quacks were prescribing candies , patients footfall getting increased in their hospital now to compete with quack you need to do quackery in order to get footfall of patients in your hospital that's how it worked.

it's not ethical that's why we need strong regulation in healthcare and pharmacy.

reddit,2025-12-06 22:31:29,"i have a game idea that could change how we understand indian politics, but i can't build it. developers/indie studios, please steal this. used ai to rewrite below:  
i was having dinner tonight after a long day at work, just doom-scrolling through the news, and honestly, i felt hopeless. the rupee is falling, the gap between the rich and poor is widening, corruption is everywhere, and delhi is choking on poisonous air. the civic sense is non-existent.

we all sit around saying, ""i want a good leader who can fix this,"" or ""if i were pm, i’d do x.""

but the reality is terrifying. i’m a data scientist working in tech. i can analyze the problems, but i can’t run for office. i don’t have the time to stand in an election, and frankly? i’m scared. in our political landscape, if you actually try to do good, you get targeted. you get threatened. sometimes, you get killed.

so, i had an idea. a way to create change without getting shot.

i want to see a game built. a serious, high-stakes simulation for everyone—kids, teenagers, adults.

the concept: you play as the prime minister of a fictional country (we can’t name it india for obvious political reasons, but the scenarios are very real).

this isn't civilization or simcity. this is a survival-political horror simulator.

* real consequences: you want to fix the pollution? great. but the industrial lobby just paid off your coalition partners, and now your government is about to collapse.
* the threat of violence: in this game, doing the ""right thing"" is dangerous. if you go too hard against corruption without diplomatic cover, your character faces assassination attempts, or your in-game family is threatened.
* ai-powered politics: the opposition and the public are powered by ai. they react irrationally, emotionally, and ruthlessly—just like in real life.
* multiplayer cabinet: you can build a cabinet with real players. but can you trust your finance minister, or are they cutting a backroom deal with the opposition?

the goal: the point of the game is to educate people on why things are so broken. it teaches that ""fixing"" a country isn't just about good intentions; it's about survival, diplomacy, and navigating a brutal system.

here is the catch: i have a demanding job and active work commitments. i cannot be the ceo of this startup. i simply do not have the hours in the day to lead development or run a studio.

i am posting this because i want someone to take this idea and run with it.

if you are a game developer, an indie studio, or a group of students looking for a capstone project—please, take this idea.

i am happy to contribute as a consultant, help with the logic/data science aspect, or just be a sounding board when i have free time. but i need a team (or a leader) who can actually own this and build it.

if this sounds like something you want to build, drop a comment or dm me. let’s discuss how to make this happen. i just want to see this exist.

# tl;dr:

i have an idea for a realistic, brutal ""pm simulator"" game where doing good gets you killed, to teach people about the reality of indian politics. i don't have time to build it due to my job. looking for devs/teams who want to take the idea and build it; i'm happy to help where i can."
reddit,2025-12-07 04:54:23,"how people are surviving india? came for a month long vacation... i used to defend india blindly. i really did.

then i came back for a vacation after years abroad — and this time, i saw things i can’t unsee.

here’s what hit me, point by point:

1. public toilets are still humiliating

i was at kollam beach in kerala. walked almost 20 minutes just to find a toilet. when i finally found one, it was absolutely disgusting. no hygiene, no dignity, no maintenance.

we talk about literacy, development, “smart india”… but we still can’t provide a usable public toilet? that one hurt.

2. the staring made me feel helpless as a husband

people stared at my wife like she wasn’t even a human being — just something to look at.

men stared. women stared. constantly.

i stared back at the men, but what do you do when it feels like the whole crowd is watching you?

when women stared, i couldn’t even react. my wife stopped feeling comfortable just walking. that broke something inside me.

3. delhi pollution doesn’t feel like pollution — it feels like poisoning

we got sick within a week of being in delhi.

the moment you step out of the airport, the air feels heavy and wrong. you can actually see the yellow haze.

people say “aqi is bad” like it’s news. it’s not news anymore. it’s just daily life — and it’s terrifying. uber driver said ""saab bahar se aya hai tum hum to used to ho gaya""

4. inflation has crushed buying power

₹500 today feels like ₹100 a few years ago.

petrol is almost ₹100 per liter.

food, rent, healthcare, education — everything is expensive except human life.

i honestly kept wondering how middle-class families are managing without being mentally exhausted all the time.

5. civic sense feels officially dead

traffic feels like survival mode. no patience. no respect. only horn and ego.

people throw garbage right next to dustbins.

i carried a blinkit paper bag to collect my trash so i could throw it properly later — and people looked at me like i was the weird one.

that’s when it hit me: doing the right thing now feels abnormal.

the hardest part?

i don’t feel angry anymore. i feel sad.

i used to think india was struggling but improving.

now it feels like we’ve just learned to live inside chaos and call it “normal.”

people say: “if you don’t like it, leave.”

but millions don’t have the option to leave.

so i’ll ask the uncomfortable question:

how are people emotionally surviving this every single day?

the pollution, the crowds, the inflation, the staring, the chaos — this isn’t small stuff. this is daily life.

i still love india.

that’s exactly why this trip hurt so much.

but the movie is unnecessarily long. i don’t have a problem with long runtimes but if you’re expecting the audience to sit through a 4 hour movie, at least justify it. half of it should not be slow-motion footage that doesn’t add any value to either the narrative or the character. it just screams, “i am telling you this guy is kewl. believe me!!!”  i got that after the first gratuitous walk of ranveer singh’s luscious hair. the volume on that crop is insane. anyway, yeah, i got that this guy is the main character. move on already. 

ranveer singh is a good actor. an actor who can be so emotive, got turned into a stoic sigma chad. i have no idea what his character is like. here’s what i know about his character: 
1. he is an indian agent. 
2. he knows guns. 
3. he has really great hair and always has a good hair day.
4. he is kewl. 

but any actor is only as good as the story and the director. that brings us to aditya dhar. i am not a fan. this feels like a movie where the director fell in love with his footage and wanted to use all of it. someone tell him that a long scene does not mean a good scene. but the guy doesn’t know when to stop. and the length of the scene, and consequentially the information relayed, works mostly to the detriment of the movie. i’ll give you an example. sanjay dutt’s character fatally shoots an important character who needs to be alive for a bit more for ranveer’s plan to work. after ranveer tells him explicitly. sanjay dutt shoots him anyway. i get the joke in that. that should have been the end. but the scene lingers, and sanjay dutt’s character feels the need to explain the joke. “put a finger in the hole, else he’ll bleed out.” i was happily oblivious up until this point. now i have a new ticking clock. with specifics attached to it. i’m worried about how he is going to slow the blood flow enough so that his plan works. next scene, he is straight up lugging him on his shoulder, both hands visible, none covering the bullet hole in the throat and my guy straight up runs through a jungle, finds civilisation, gets rejected by two cars and is finally able to flag an auto. the character then dies exactly when he’s supposed to. my point is, why point it out if it does not have any bearing whatsoever on your yarn of convenience? my immersion is broken and i’m wondering what the fuck this movie even is about? 

there was so much potential for conflict for ranveer’s character. let’s look at sanyal babu ka plan for a bit. so, basically, madhavan is putting together a team of unique individuals who are on death row and will perform dangerous, black ops behind enemy lines, and if captured, the govt will disown them. so… they some kind of suicide squad? 
let’s look at this from ranveer’s character’s motivation for a second. he’s on death row for a reason. he may have committed some small crime that put him on death row. he’s dying. he gets to live and move to a country away from the influence of the people trying to hang him. he can start over. he doesn’t even consider it? 
he worked with rahman dakait for so long. he doesn’t see what he does for the people of lyari? and if there was no strong emotional theme between rahman dakait and ranveer’s character, why was that scene where he hallucinates dakait after he dies. if it was all business for him, what the fuck was that scene for? and ranveer suddenly remembers that he is an indian spy, and so does the audience, like “abey haan, ye angle bhi to hai”. and then he gets embroiled in something or the other and the both of us forget again. the scene where we see some flashbacks of his parents, i guess, what is that scene trying to tell me. yes it is a very difficult situation for ranveer’s character and i am seeing a man and a woman i don’t really know a lot about and i’m supposed to feel something? who is ranveer singh’s character, apart from being the indian spy? i have no emotional connection to the protagonist so i don’t really care for his predicament. the emotion in that scene comes from the terror attack that actually happened. is that supposed to do all the heavy lifting while aditya dhar throws some random images on screen and tells me “look. absolute cinema!”

and how big is this rahman dakait outfit anyway? i know like 5 people. there’s only one shot where when he is rescued from sanjay dutt’s character and a whole bunch of people with guns are going rahman bhai rahman bhai! the only obstacle for ranveer was that it’s difficult to get into the gang. once he’s in, he is the right hand man. he rose so fast through the ranks of a criminal enterprise that it’ll make sydney sweeny dizzy. and he had no enemies or even rivals in said enterprise. cool. nobody does a background check on this guy, who entered the enterprise under very suspicious circumstances and was suddenly the boss’s favourite. clearly, this is not my company. i’m looking at you durgesh. 
then comes his girlfriend. i have no inkling of ranveer’s feelings towards that girl. does he like her, is he using her? is she nothing more than a pawn in his scheme? but nice of aditya dhar to give her some agency when she chooses to stay with ranveer. the original songs of this movie are abhorrent. indistinguishable from the regular sappy slop ft. arijit singh we are used to. (foos foos!)

but finally, i still don’t know what the movie was about. was it a gritty spy thriller, massy action movie, a chronicle of the baloch gang from the late 90s? was it aditya snyder’s baloch league or sandeep reddy dhar’s pakistan ka janawar? whatever it was intended to be, it became a vehicle for akshaye khanna to grab the movie by the neck and show everyone how it is done. 

one last point: if you’re going to show gore, at least make the cgi good? i have nothing against showing gore in a movie for adults. but it has to be justified. or just visually consistent? and if you can’t do that properly, save those 5 seconds. we get that you’re edgy, aditya. 

and what’s with the stormtrooper aim? i swear, sanjay dutt is the only competent police guy. the rest cant hit a dummy even if it crashes into their gun on its own. there is one guy you are shooting at, he is built like a rhino, so not a small target. he is standing in the middle of the road, no cover and he is just rampaging there for 5-10 straight minutes. you’re 30 cops with assault rifles. 

the movie is four hours long, and has the audacity to give me a recap at the end, while showing me a trailer for the next movie. basically, arya stark is a faceless person now, so she can finally go through her kill list. 

i feel like i’m missing a few points but koi na! in the end, someone tell aditya dhar the following things: 

1. don’t get high on your own supply. 
2. fair and lovely lagaane se actually gore nahi hote hain. 
3. a long scene does not mean a good scene. 

there is very good movie hiding in all this footage. but it is not what we got. 

so much potential of character conflict, but instead we got aura masturbation. no hate on acting, production design, cinematography etc etc. the script was shit. and the dialogues! ghayal hu isliye ghatak hu comes out of nowhere. no build up to that. no way the conversation led to that dialogue. it was just so unnatural to see it shoehorned in there. and don’t get me started on the sone ki chidiya line. you fucking idiot, these two countries have the same history except the last 40 years. 

maybe i’m stupid. i’m definitely sleepy. i’ve wasted around 8 hours of my life on this.

- a terrorist attack: it is the people on the inside from a certain community who are the villains, not the intelligence and security failure that enabled it.

- dirty cities: it is people who “lack civic sense,” not municipal bodies that fail to build working sanitation systems.

- pollution: it is farmers burning stubble, not corporations, construction mafias, vehicle lobbies and weak environmental enforcement.

- unemployment: it is the laziness of youth, not an education system that fails to create real employable skills or dignified jobs.

- crimes against women: it is the woman’s clothes and behavior, not a broken policing system, slow courts, and zero fear of punishment.

- train and aircraft accidents: it is sabotage or human error, not chronic underinvestment, mismanagement, and political neglect of rail safety.

- overcrowded trains: it is “ticketless freeloaders,” not rising fares, stagnant capacity, and collapsed public transport planning.

- potholes and floods: it is careless drivers and illegal homes, not corrupt contractors, drainage failures, and zero urban accountability.

- medical bankruptcies: it is poor financial planning, not a healthcare system gutted by privatization and price gouging.

- housing and slums: it is people choosing to live badly, not the complete failure of affordable housing policy in cities.

the accident happened near indiranagar, bengaluru. neighbors heard her screams and immediately called the police, but unfortunately, by the time help arrived, it was already too late.

she was originally from madhya pradesh and had moved to bengaluru trusting it as a tier-1 city where basic safety standards would be ensured. if someone cannot feel safe even inside their own home, then where are we truly safe?

this raises serious questions:

are there proper policies or inspections in place to ensure electrical safety in rental homes?

why are landlords not held accountable for such negligence?

no matter what we do now, she will not come back. but the responsible parties must be held accountable so that such incidents do not happen again to others who leave their hometowns and move to cities like bengaluru for work.

what legal steps can be taken to get justice for her?

the timings are a complete joke. we’re expected to wait anywhere between 6 am and 8 am, constantly alert, ears open for their whistles because they can show up anytime without warning. there is no fixed schedule, no predictability, no accountability.

there is zero consideration for office-going people. not everyone can stand around every morning waiting for garbage trucks like we’re unemployed. people have jobs, calls, commutes, responsibilities. missing one collection means waste piling up, and then residents are blamed for “black spots” or illegal dumping.

what exactly is a working household supposed to do?

wake up early every day just in case they show up?

keep waste inside indefinitely?

take time off work to manage garbage?


this isn’t about citizens being irresponsible, this is a system designed without any regard for how people actually live.

dear modi ji,

your story has been exceptionally inspirational; it is one in a kind. in a nation of dynastic rule and feudalism you climbed the ladder of success and escaped the shackles of misery to reach the pinnacle. i am writing this to you to express my feelings about the state of affairs of my country which is guarded by you, your nobles and your party. i hope i am not labelled as an anti-national but i have nothing to worry about, i am competent and i have resources and will to fight with you and your system, it is my nation after all, not just yours.

it is very hard to govern india, most populous nation in world with so much diversity across the spectrum coupled with poverty and sectarian issues. i agree that you cannot alone solve everything and we do not expect that from you. we are hardworking people who believe in constitution, god and importance of education and honesty in nation building process, it is us who have worked since the inception of this union and funded the government of india to sustain and impart law, order and an efficient grundnorm across length and breadth of our land and it is important that you and your colleagues be reminded of that. i am not here to whine about problems we face; the common population has no expectation from you and any politician to solve our issues- we will deal with them but there is this one thing that has got on my nerve and forced me to sit and write this letter to you.

sir, we the people of india might be weak in our temperament, we might lack an understanding of this nation, we might be ignorant, we might be less pious as you but we are not fools. we deserve acknowledgement of our problems in parliament and in policy meetings of your cabinet, the temple of democracy is not a vote garnering machine for your party and cash cow for your capitalist friends. it is something which is standing because of the sacrifices made by us, the people who live here. it should serve our interests and not just the interests of people sitting in it. today, in amrit kal, sir, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food, the places of our worship, the roads we drive on, the schools we go to, the hospitals we visit and the booths we vote on are all crumbling from a slope. the slope which is sustained by you and your party for the power. the father of our nation rightly quoted that power corrupts, it had stung and corrupted a pious man like you. it had turned you from someone we looked upto in admiration to somebody who makes us feel cheated.

you can fix this but i know you will not. it is great you built temples in your reign but remember we have to pay to see the form of your god properly, there are people who are not allowed to enter temples and there are kids who entail in menial activities like begging outside these mammoth institutions of worship that you built. we want you to fix that but i know you will not do so, you are in a deep quagmire- surrounded by incompetent ministers, chief ministers and civil servants who have no vision and scientific temper to take this country forward and who are only capable of manipulating poor and keep them in ignorance by means of religion, fear and hyper-nationalism. sir, i am writing all this in my complete senses and no i am not a chinese or pakistani agent. i know you are not competent to solve our problems but my only request is to please acknowledge them and try to find people who can solve them, it will need you to think above your vote bank and ego but it is a better choice for you. do not force to us rise and retaliate. as i said we just want a state which is efficient in administration and assure us a life of dignity.

sir, our forefathers built a nation in which a son of a poor family became prime minister. i hope you leave us a nation where we can atleast breathe and raise our progeny.

a citizen of union of india."
reddit,2025-12-16 14:01:37,"alternative political party in india **came across a post earlier today discussing alternative political parties in india. i couldn’t track it down later, but it sparked some thoughts i wanted to share.**

a  big, uncomfortable point was raised in that post: “can a party of educated, ‘honest’ people fix india and deal with its issues?

the problem isn’t just “bad leaders” or “corrupt politicians” – it’s that a large part of society wants the same shortcuts, kickbacks, and conveniences that those leaders represent.

**so the real question is, “can a party of educated, ‘honest’ people really fix a fundamentally undisciplined society?”**

we like to blame politicians, “the system”, or “uneducated masses” for everything wrong with our country. but honestly, the rot is not just at the top. it runs straight through regular, educated, middle-class people like us. i’m increasingly convinced that our core problem isn’t lack of intelligence, education, or money. it’s a lack of discipline, respect for rules, and any real concept of a shared society.

look at the most basic stuff (highlighting everyday indiscipline):

* people jumping red lights and ignoring traffic rules.
* throwing garbage wherever is convenient, with zero sense of shared neighbourhood.
* pushing into queues, blocking doors in trains/buses/lifts, and stopping in the middle of the road to get off.
* blaring loud music in the name of personal celebration or religious events/blocking roads and disrupting traffic for religious congregations or processions. public inconvenience is often brushed off as “faith” or “tradition,” with little accountability.
* “gaming” customers/clients at every possible opportunity.
* small-time shops and service providers hiding income or avoiding taxes while complaining about government inefficiency
* no dignity of labour – looking down on people who do essential but “low-status” work.

these are not complex policy failures. these are character failures. and they cut across class, language, and education.

**when the “educated” are the problem: two personal examples:**

* i’ve been part of multiple college bodies/committees. for many peers, the primary motive was simple: get close to the system and make money. no sense of “the system is corrupt; we should try to fix it.” instead, it was: “the system is corrupt; i want my share.”
* ·medical system corruption: in medical practice, the rot is even deeper. everything can involve a cut – college seat recognition, recruitment, machine purchases, and medicine procurement. one concrete example: in a tertiary care centre, a basic injection like triamcinolone acetonide from a reputed brand (abbott, around ₹80) was not available. instead, the hospital store pushed a “generic” version priced around ₹120, sold with a 20% discount to make it look cheap. the product was so poor in quality that it wouldn’t even dissolve properly in the syringe. that’s how i started examining the brand.

the question is obvious: who heads the pharmacy committee? who approved this? who pockets the kickback? these are not “evil outsiders”. these are doctors, administrators – people from similar social and educational backgrounds as us. and almost no one objects, because everyone either benefits or hopes to benefit from the same system.

“people like us” are the system in both education and healthcare. i’ve seen the same pattern: the corruption is not imposed from above; it is co-created by ordinary, well-read, “respectable” people. almost nobody wants to take real action because they want to be part of the network when it benefits them.  they don’t want to be the odd one out and risk their own career.

**so we end up with this hypocrisy: we want to personally enjoy the advantages of a broken system and then complain that our leaders are corrupt. why would we magically elect saints when most of us don’t behave like saints in our own little spheres of power?**

do we actually want discipline?

we keep saying, “we need educated, honest people in politics.” but i don’t think education or money is the real differentiator. what we actually need are people who:

* respect the constitution and rule of law.
* value the dignity of labour.
* understand shared public spaces and common resources.
* are willing to sacrifice short-term personal gain for long-term public good.

and that kind of person is incredibly rare. even when such individuals or parties appear, the average voter is often swayed by :

* grandeur and personality cults.
* unaccountable power and display of wealth.
* caste/religion identity.
* the fantasy of “if my person is in power, i’ll also benefit.”

**in other words, voters end up choosing a “true representative” – someone who acts exactly like they would if they had that power.**

another uncomfortable observation (personal opinion, not looking to debate theology): in very religious societies, people often “do good” out of fear of god or punishment in the afterlife, not because it’s intrinsically right. religion also offers convenient mechanisms of repentance: commit wrongdoing, then offset it via ritual, donation, or some symbolic act. this can unintentionally enable indiscipline and unethical behaviour, because you always have a moral “reset button”.

i’m not saying all religious people are unethical. i’m saying overtly religious cultures can sometimes externalise morality (“god is watching”) instead of internalising it (“i must do the right thing even if nobody is watching”).

so, can “honest, educated” parties change anything? parties like aap or people like prashant kishor initially gave hope that a cleaner, more technocratic, educated leadership might reset the system. but what did we see?

* they faced massive resistance from existing interests.
* the public, including people like us, eventually tore them down, mocked them, or moved on.
* the system pushed back – and society wasn’t disciplined or principled enough to hold the line and defend them.

if the broad social culture doesn’t change, any “honest” party that comes to power will have two options:

* adapt to the existing dirty system to survive.
* fight it and get crushed or sidelined.

**without a critical mass of citizens who actually practice discipline and integrity in daily life, i suspect any such party can at best bring fleeting, cosmetic change.**

 

tl;dr :

**if large parts of society themselves are corrupt, undisciplined, and opportunistic, can a party of educated, “honest” individuals truly change the system in a lasting way? or will the system inevitably change them instead?**

disclaimer: ideas/thoughts are mine. reframed using perplexity."

according to me, the major reason for health problems was not getting proper food and consuming high ldl foods. another reason i told was cortisol and stress. 

i had given him examples of researches and studies which shows the difference in amount of pesticides in organic and non-organic food which was very minimal difference and as stated earlier would need huge quantities on a daily basis. so that guy had no logic and just said that reasearches are fake and manipulated so that the people stay in peace and don't panic. he also said that the country wants its image to be good internationally, so it manipulates the studies. 

this lead us to the argument where we were discussing the aqi numbers of delhi and this guy was like, the numbers are kept around 400-600 purposefully (even these numbers are hazardous and don't make the image of india better.). then another guy came and said it is better, the actual numbers would be around 2000.

then i tried to explain them about the devices which detect pm2.5 and pm10 particles and individuals can also buy them but they refused to listen.  
also had a discussion on ground water report from cgwb.

these guys were not someone with some scientific temprament and call other people ""padhe likhe andpadh""  as they themselves are not enough qualfied to falsify my statements.

  
but still, do you guys believe that these reports are actually manipulated? also some are done by the international agencies and firms which are independent."
reddit,2025-12-16 19:47:29,"mah country ! mah rules! so now we’re told that india sets its *own* air quality standards, and that there is no “official” global ranking for pollution anyway. fair enough. after all, consistency has never been the goal.

gdp calculations? set our own standards.  
democracy ratings? set our own standards.  
road construction statistics? set our own standards.  
and now pollution too? naturally, we set our own standards.

because pollution in india is apparently not the same as pollution outside india. indian air has character. indian lungs have resilience. foreign lungs are just weak, overdramatic, and probably anti-national.

by that logic, a disclaimer is long overdue for the press freedom index as well. godi media openly and enthusiastically licking the bjp’s boots should be recognized as a *unique form of journalistic freedom*. it’s not suppression, it’s devotion. totally different standard.

it increasingly feels like the governing philosophy is simple: when you can’t change the problem, change the definition of the problem. or better yet, change the name of the problem. call it “development haze” or “nation-building smog.” problem solved. credit to godi ji and the yupi-wale school of thought for this innovation.

meanwhile, those who can afford it quietly exit the scene. the rich and privileged flee to europe or the middle east, where the air is breathable and accountability still exists. dubai is already full of bhakts enjoying first-world air with third-world nationalism. the rest are expected to inhale whatever’s left and stay grateful for 5 kg of free ration.

the real entertainment, though, comes from the hardcore psycho-bhakts. according to them, air pollution can be measured with a thermometer, cooking gas can be produced from drains, clouds can hide fighter jets from radar, and now running outside for half an hour in aqi 2000 will probably be declared “cardio.” from now on, the minimum fever to see a doctor will be 100 degrees *centigrade*. new standards, remember?

all of this, of course, has been intellectually certified by modistein, a man with phds in every branch of mathematics, science, economics, and whatsapp university logic. questioning him is anti-national.

at this point, bjp is slowly transforming into what used to be satirical parody in comedy skits. the irony is that satire is now obsolete. you can’t parody the bjp anymore, because even parody has its own standard now, and they’ve already surpassed it."

reddit,2025-12-18 04:04:16,"indigo’s rise was capitalism working until it stopped working! i was listening to a lighthearted podcast where the hosts were joking about the indigo mess. they traced it back to 2024, when the central government increased pilots’ weekly rest time to 48 hours. one host said this was one of those rare moments where the government was actually right and the corporates just ignored the warning. that made me pause. really, the government made zero mistakes here. seriously.

i had always assumed the government created an indigo monopoly. i believed there was no way indigo jumped from about 31 percent market share in 2014 to nearly 70 percent by 2025 without government help. turns out i was wrong. i searched and searched and could not find any special favors given to indigo that explain this rise.

back in 2014, the market was fairly spread out. indigo had around 32 percent, jet was close to 22 percent, air india about 18 percent, spicejet around 17 percent and goair near 9 percent. this was not a monopoly market.

one major thing the government did after 2014 which immensely helped the growth of indigo was push airport infrastructure hard. new terminals, better runways, night landing facilities, fancy airports everywhere. and this is where i have a problem. only about 3 percent of indians fly. instead of spending huge money on glossy airports, the government should have focused on regular trains used by ordinary people, not flashy overpriced vande bharat trains for photo ops.

then there is air india. it had nearly 20 percent market share while under government ownership and still managed to perform badly. that is also a government failure. add to that jet airways making terrible strategic decisions and kingfisher collapsing under its own stupidity. all of this cleared the runway for indigo.

indigo won because it was boring, disciplined, cost focused and executed well. others failed because they were badly run. that is not favoritism. that is capitalism doing its job.

but did indigo end up becoming a monopoly. yes. and once that happens, a strange extra bone grows. you stop listening. you gain bargaining power. you know the government will blink first.

look at the recent crisis. the government asked indigo to refund passengers, not compensate them properly. that itself shows weakness. that is what monopoly power looks like.

and indigo is not alone.

in many cities, piped gas is controlled by a single company. no choice, no escape, rising tariffs. in electricity, private players like tata power in delhi or adani electricity in mumbai control entire areas. regulation exists on paper, but consumers cannot switch.

telecom is now a jio and airtel duopoly. after brutal pricing wiped out competition, tariffs are climbing, service quality is dropping and suddenly discipline has vanished.

airports are another story. adani controls many major airports. fees rise, food is overpriced, airlines pay more and passengers ultimately foot the bill.

ports and shipping are dominated by one large private group. when one company controls trade gateways, logistics costs rise and everyone from farmers to exporters pays for it.

cement is cartel territory. big players raise prices together without shame. housing and infrastructure become more expensive and the common person suffers.

when companies become too big to touch, prices rise for no reason, service quality drops, innovation dies, regulators hesitate and consumers have no exit. this is not ideology. this is history on repeat.

the irony is painful. the same people screaming at airports and abusing indigo staff, who are underpaid and overworked, are happily using these monopolies and duopolies every day. they are just not angry yet. when the time comes, they will shout there too.

if this is how the country is run, where ministers act more like brokers for giant corporations, everyone will eventually be screaming.

and just as a final thought, today’s news says adani power is one of six companies shortlisted for a 25 billion dollar power project in south africa. the prime minister recently met south african officials at the g20 summit.

now take a wild guess. who do you think will get the contract."
reddit,2025-12-18 17:42:05,"interiors disaster? neighbour’s nightmare with livspace, urban company, homelane, nobroker interiors you know that feeling when you dream of a perfectly designed home and end up running a mini-drama instead? that’s exactly what happened to a friend in my apartment. they hired a “managed” interior service, lured by promises of professional supervision, timely delivery, and zero headaches.  
the reality? a chaotic circus.  
labour teams kept showing up late or in completely different groups each day.  
cabinets and wardrobes arrived scratched, some panels didn’t fit at all, and paint looked like a toddler’s attempt at abstract art.  
electrical fittings were installed wrong, tiles chipped, and the promised precision was nowhere to be seen.  
the assigned project supervisor? a ghost. whenever urgent decisions were needed, it was radio silence.  
reporting damages? a nightmare. the platform blamed contractors, the contractors blamed schedules, and my friend ended up running around like a project manager, logistics coordinator, and customer service rep all at once.  
meanwhile, neighbours who had gone with nobroker interiors seemed to fare slightly better. their issues were acknowledged, followed up on, and in some cases actually fixed. not perfect, but at least someone took responsibility, unlike the rest who just passed the buck.  
this makes you wonder: are platforms like livspace, urban company, homelane, and nobroker interiors really “managed,” or are they just polished apps selling dreams while leaving customers to deal with reality?  
so i’m asking the community:  
have you experienced similar disasters with interiors services?  
which platforms actually took responsibility when things went wrong?  
or are trusted independent contractors still the only reliable option, even without formal guarantees?  
because at this point, “managed interiors” feels less like a service and more like a marketing story and someone’s got to tell the truth."

people are protesting to save the aravalli, not because they are against development…
but because some developments are blind, greedy, and destructive.

the aravalli is not just a mountain range.
it is our water holder, air filter, climate shield, and desert barrier.
it quietly protects north india from heat, drought, dust storms, and desertification.

in simple words:
👉 the aravalli keeps our land livable… our water alive… and our air breathable.

what hurts more is not ignorance.
it is the mindset behind the destruction.

some believe that by cutting hills, mining forests, and bending laws…
they can multiply money.
some believe people can be fooled forever.
some misuse power and position.
some don’t even bother to listen to protests.

and i refuse to believe that authorities do not know the repercussions.
they know.
everyone knows.

you cannot destroy an ecosystem and expect life to remain normal.

we are breathing poison.
we are drinking poison.
we are eating poison.
and still we call this “growth”.

yes, development is needed.
but not at the cost of destroying the very systems that sustain life.

why do we need such mindless development?
why not middle-path development … where humans grow with nature, not against it?

taking what is needed is intelligence.
taking what we want endlessly is greed.

for how long will we loot land, forests, water, and air…
and still call ourselves civilized?

this is not progress.
this is brutality.

saving the aravalli is not about trees alone.
it is about whether we choose consciousness over convenience.

as sadhguru reminds us…
ecology is not about saving the planet.
it is about saving ourselves.

the aravalli must stand."
reddit,2025-12-19 22:39:39,"a basic guide to a much-needed civic sense culture in residential societies in india civic sense in india has become a fashionable social-media slogan - typed passionately from the comfort of a posh society in bengaluru/delhi/mumbai. ironically, many of the loudest voices crying about “lack of civic sense” are the same people who block entrances with parked cars, litter common spaces, shout into their phones at night, and treat shared facilities as personal property. this selective outrage - moral on instagram, careless in real life - has turned civic responsibility into a performance rather than a practice. civic sense isn’t proved by pointing fingers online; it begins quietly, daily, and inconveniently, in the very spaces we share with others - especially residential societies.

* don’t park your car anywhere or in common-area spaces that are not designated for you. ***emergency access and other residents’ convenience matter.***
* use common/open areas only for activities meant for shared spaces. playing cricket, bursting firecrackers, or similar activities should be done in appropriate locations - not inside residential common areas.
* if you have a pet, ***ensure that your pet’s faecal matter is cleaned and disposed of in dustbins.*** pet ownership comes with responsibility - this is basic hygiene, not a “foreign concept.”
* not everyone is comfortable around pets. ***if your society has a service lift, please use it for pets instead of forcing others to adjust.***
* no loud music after 10 p.m. sound travels more than you think, and people have different schedules.
* you don’t need to gather outside someone’s house to hear/participate in gossip or discuss society matters. respect privacy - ***what doesn’t concern you isn’t your business.***
* ***press the lift button only if you intend to use it immediately.*** don’t stop lifts unnecessarily ***even if it's for ""2 minutes""*** \- others may have urgent reasons to reach their floors/attend to.
* don’t block staircases, corridors, or fire exits with shoes, plants, cycles, or furniture. these are safety hazards, not storage spaces.
* teach children to respect shared spaces. lifts, lobbies, and parking areas are not playgrounds.
* dispose of garbage properly - use designated bins, follow segregation rules, and don’t leave trash outside doors or in lifts.
* avoid unnecessary honking inside society premises. it disturbs residents and adds no value.
* ***respect security staff, housekeeping, and maintenance workers.*** courtesy costs nothing and reflects your upbringing.
* follow society rules for renovations - noise timings, debris disposal, and permissions exist for a reason.
* ***don’t assume common resources are unlimited.*** water, electricity, and backup power should be used responsibly.
* in case of a disagreement or fight with your neighbours, use words and remain respectful. violence, threats, stereotypes, or physical intimidation are never acceptable and only worsen the situation. you might end up nationalising your entire fights. we have as it is, enough to discuss about."

the stench has become unbearable. people are forced to hold their breath while walking or riding past these areas. in some places, the situation has worsened to the point where garbage is openly burned just to reduce the pile, filling the air with toxic smoke.


even more heartbreaking is seeing cattle, goats, and stray dogs feeding on this waste.


it’s deeply saddening to watch public spaces deteriorate so rapidly and how retarded people are.

reddit,2025-12-21 09:27:42,"the source of all of india’s troubles: religion when religion dominates governance, corruption stops being a bug and becomes a feature. institutionalized religion rewards public displays of piety over measurable outcomes, which is perfect cover for dishonesty and neglect. politicians can ignore air quality, water security, sanitation, and basic infrastructure as long as they perform belief. india’s collapsing aqi levels, which routinely rank among the worst in the world, are treated as background noise compared to religious symbolism and spectacle (https://www.iqair.com/world-air-quality-ranking). air you cannot breathe does not mobilize voters the way gods do.

this religious capture produces grotesque misallocation of resources. india has vast coastlines and worsening water stress, yet large scale desalination remains limited and politically unglamorous (https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2021-02/water\_vision\_2050.pdf). at the same time, billions are celebrated for statues, temple restorations, and religious monuments that generate no productivity, no resilience, and no public health benefit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statue\_of\_unity, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ram\_mandir). roads go unswept, drains clog, waste burns in the open, and cities choke because maintenance and invisible infrastructure do not deliver emotional payoff. faith based spending does.

religion also corrodes honesty at the civic level. when belief replaces evidence, lying becomes normalized. politicians can promise miracles instead of metrics, rituals instead of results. scientific temper, explicitly mandated by the constitution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article\_51a\_of\_the\_constitution\_of\_india), is sacrificed because it threatens the system. rational citizens ask uncomfortable questions. devout crowds do not. the result is apathy toward basics. why fix sewage when you can inaugurate a shrine. why invest in road sweepers, waste processing, or pollution control when chanting slogans buys loyalty faster.

this creates a vicious loop. religious ideology suppresses curiosity and accountability, which enables corruption, which deepens public resignation. people stop expecting clean air, safe water, or functional infrastructure and instead seek meaning in spectacle. that psychological numbing mirrors addiction. the brain is rewarded with emotional certainty while real problems are ignored. research shows dogmatic belief systems reduce analytical thinking and cognitive flexibility, exactly the mental traits needed to demand competent governance (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0439-3).

the outrage is not that india is spiritual. the outrage is that belief has been weaponized to excuse incompetence. religion in public life functions like a disease that dulls pain receptors while the body decays. corruption thrives, dishonesty is normalized, and apathy toward basic human needs becomes patriotic.

tldr: when religion dominates governance, it acts like a social disease. it suppresses curiosity, enables corruption, rewards dishonesty, and numbs citizens to choking air, water scarcity, broken sanitation, and crumbling infrastructure. temples and statues multiply while roads stay filthy, desalination stalls, and aqi worsens. india’s crisis is not lack of money or talent. it is the choice to anesthetize society with belief instead of fixing reality."

this is not outrage culture.
this is not pessimism.
this is a reality check.

aravalli hills are being destroyed openly  ecosystems erased for profit. according to environmental researchers and supreme court observations, the aravalli range acts as a natural barrier against desertification and groundwater depletion, yet large portions have lost legal protection due to redefinitions that allow mining and construction.

babies as young as nine years old are raped. ncrb data shows that over 31,000 rape cases were reported in india in 2022, with a significant percentage involving minors. a child touches his own grandmother inappropriately while she lies bedridden in a hospital. this is not just crime; this is a failure of moral and social systems.

men and women are pushed into endless hatred instead of accountability. people are lynched, burned alive, and murdered for caste, religion, and so-called “honour.” according to ncrb, honour killings and caste-based violence continue to be reported every year, despite constitutional guarantees of equality.

this is not civilisation.
this is moral collapse.

our roads are so badly built that accidents feel inevitable. india reports over 4.5 lakh road accidents every year, killing more than 1.6 lakh people annually (ministry of road transport &amp; highways). most of these deaths are preventable caused by potholes, poor design, lack of enforcement, and corruption.

the air is so toxic that breathing itself shortens our lives. research published in the lancet estimates that air pollution causes around 15-17 lakh premature deaths in india every year. many indian cities routinely record aqi levels 8-10 times higher than who safe limits. yet we are told it’s “just seasonal” or “not proven.”

rivers are polluted beyond recognition. according to cpcb data, hundreds of river stretches in india are classified as polluted, unfit even for bathing yet they remain primary water sources for millions.

politicians stand in parliament without basic literacy and confidently dismiss scientific realities. corruption is no longer hidden  it is institutionalised.

food companies knowingly feed us carcinogenic chemicals for profit. studies by fssai and independent labs have repeatedly flagged pesticide residues, adulteration, and harmful additives in everyday food items. the rupee keeps falling. children are forced to beg. according to unicef, millions of indian children are engaged in child labour or begging, despite laws against it.

people perform absurd, often dangerous acts in the name of religion, while fake godmen roam the world in luxury cars, designer clothes, and private jets. the police won’t move unless money changes hands. transparency international consistently ranks india poorly on corruption perception compared to developed democracies.

government paperwork doesn’t move for months or years unless bribes are paid. people are still judged, mistreated, and excluded purely based on caste







let’s talk about daily life, without pretending:

•you can’t eat because food is adulterated.

•you can’t drink water because rivers are polluted.

•you can’t walk freely because it isn’t safe.

•you can’t breathe because the air is poisonous.

•you can’t get quality education unless you pay obscene private-school fees.

•you can’t drive safely because roads are broken and traffic laws are optional.

•you can die because a drunk, rich driver feels untouchable.


and through all this, we are told to be “grateful.”

now let’s talk about taxes.

we pay tax when we earn.
we pay tax when we spend.
we pay tax on fuel, food, phones, clothes, transport, education, healthcare nearly everything.

india’s indirect taxes (gst, fuel taxes) mean even the poorest citizens contribute daily. yet what do we get in return?

unsafe roads.
polluted air and water.
broken public education.
overburdened public hospitals.
a justice system that moves faster for the powerful than for victims.

so the question is simple: what exactly are we paying for?

#what is the government doing ...and most importantly what are we doing?

because here is the uncomfortable truth: governments do not improve societies on their own. societies force governments to improve. power does not reform itself out of kindness.

elections alone are not enough. voting once every five years and then disengaging is how dysfunction survives. silence, distraction, and division are the most effective tools of decay.

and we the youth of india  are running out of excuses.

this is not about political parties.
this is not about ideology.
this is about accountability, dignity, and basic human life.

if we don’t demand better systems, better governance, and better ethics, we will keep living shorter, angrier, more fearful lives and call it normal.

i am not writing this to complain. i am writing this because i want to act, and i know many others feel the same helpless rage.

i don’t have resources. i don’t have platforms. i don’t have safety nets. i have limited time, limited money, and limited tools. but i still have something that matters conscience.

so i ask this not as an accusation, but as a challenge:

if being human still means something,
if citizenship still carries responsibility,
if youth still represents possibility

#where do we start?

because if we don’t take things into our own hands ethically, collectively, relentlessly nothing will change. and history will not be kind to a generation that saw everything clearly and still chose comfort over courage.






#before you scroll away, take a minute to think not about what others should do, but about what you can do. write down every small, practical step that could make your surroundings more humane, more honest, more livable. no action is too minor if it’s consistent. societies don’t collapse overnight, and they don’t heal overnight either they change when enough people decide to act instead of adjust."

the cutting down of aravalli is another major case- modi has given aravalli hills to adani for mining, supreme court changes the definition of hill, just so that they can cut down the aravalli hills, it will be major blow for the ecosystem of the northern region, there are protests going on and govt is giving a blind eye to it.

there are many issues like corruption, lack of education, the rupee collapse, unemployment, poverty and yet the the parliament is discussing vande mataram train.

under modi and bjp rule the supreme court a independent judiciary body has become the puppet of the govt, govt is doing what they want, filling the pockets of indian billionaires and their own and nobody is there to stop them. when rahul gandhi exposed the election scam the govt used the election commission to shut him down. we aren't living in democratic india anymore, it is a pure dictatorship of modi and bjp government.

if this goes on and we keep quite the india will be doomed in upcoming years from all aspects financial, economical and environmentally.

reddit,2025-12-23 21:45:54,"hindu khatre mein hai! hindu khatre mein hai because:

in november 2025, the supreme court narrowed the definition of the aravalli range. only land that rises at least 100 meters above nearby areas now counts as aravalli. in plain terms, this conveniently clears the way for large scale mining to resume. the result will be severe ecological damage to the natural barrier that protects north india.

hindu khatre mein hai because:

in 2021, lakshmi organic industries, owned by the goenka family, set up a company in italy to acquire miteni spa. miteni was shut down after one of europe’s biggest environmental scandals. it was found to be releasing dangerous forever chemicals known as pfas. around three to three and a half lakh people were affected.

lakshmi organics acquired the plant, technology, patents and production methods. the same chemicals are now planned to be produced at lote parshuram midc in ratnagiri. same process, new location, same risks.

hindu khatre mein hai because:

on 21 december 2025, the president approved the shanti bill. it was passed by parliament without detailed scrutiny by a joint parliamentary committee.

the bill opens nuclear power to private companies while limiting their liability for accidents to rs. 3000 crore. for context, the fukushima disaster cost nearly 200 billion dollars.

worse, affected citizens, activists and even state governments cannot directly file cases or claim compensation. everything must go through a central government appointed claims commissioner. criminal cases against private operators are also restricted. regular courts are off limits. special tribunals controlled by the centre will decide everything.

if a disaster larger than bhopal happens, people will have nowhere to turn.

almost immediately after the bill was cleared, adani enterprises began discussions with the uttar pradesh government for a commercial nuclear project. make of that what you will.

hindu khatre mein hai because:

the bombay high court has allowed the removal of over 45,000 mangroves for the versova bhayander coastal road.

more than 1800 trees were set to be cut in tapovan, nashik for preparations for the 2027 kumbh mela.

air quality across india is collapsing.

delhi stands at 309.

mumbai at 131.

pune at 155.

kolkata at 231.

in parts of up, punjab and haryana, the numbers are even worse.

gorakhpur 434.

i'm sick that we as a whole lack basic etiquettes and it's become so normal that we no longer question it.( u'll come across people throwing garbage anywhere.)

i'm so sick that my only plan is to leave this country. because this is bound to fail at some point. the system will collapse if a greater power doesn't come into play. the environment and living conditions will collapse if we move only towards a capitalist and exploitive society. and we will fail as youth if we don't innovate and create solutions. because chatgpt ain't gonna come solve this for ya.

peace out. that was my rant."

i found a golden retriever near asha tiffins yesterday. i’ve tried really hard to locate the owner in the area but haven’t had any luck so far. i honestly can’t tell if he’s lost or abandoned.
he’s very sweet and friendly. please help amplify this post so it can reach the owner 🙏
if anyone recognises him, knows of any shelters or ngos that could take him in, or is interested in adopting, please let me know. most importantly, i just want to help him find his home or a safe place.
also, please let me know if there are other groups, subreddits, or instagram pages where i should post this so it reaches the right people. any leads or shares would really help. thank you!!!!

update: the dog was abandoned by the mother of the family. they accepted it. their home is 8+ km away,  she came till aecs and left the dog.
the son and daughter of the family were not aware and primary care givers to the dog.
they got it know it today, and started finding the dog and contacted me.
we closed the matter at hal police station,  with the facts the dog was severely mistreated,  had very bad tick infection and was starved for 3 days. 
they pledged to take care of the dog's health and not leave him or else will have to take responsibility. 
small update 
to make sure the dog is safe and well cared for, the whitefield canine squad, along with bbmp, will do regular checks. the first check will be on january 4. by then, the dog is expected to be recovering from tick fever.
if the owners do not follow the written commitment they gave about caring for the dog at hal police station and not abandoning it, an nc will be filed and the dog will be taken away from them. if the dog is ever found abandoned, missing, or used for breeding, strict action will be taken.
hopefully, this situation will not happen again."

due to an internal dispute between colive and the building owner, electricity has been disconnected today, while 7 days of my stay are still remaining.

i am currently left without accommodation, and colive has not refunded my deposit. their support team is non-responsive and the manager who showed me the room is not helping at all. i have filed a police complaint against the company and would proceed further if i get no response from them.

sharing my experience since i had many doubts before my appointment and figured this might help others.

# case details

* **type:** re-issue of passport
* **scheme:** tatkal
* **purpose:** deletion of ecr → ecnr
* **psk:** bengaluru – sai arcade
* **police verification:** post-issuance

# important steps before counters (many people miss this)

# 1️⃣ tatkal counter at entry

after entry, **tatkal applicants must go to the tatkal counter first**.

* they give you a **tatkal undertaking form**
* you need to tick/select **3 identity documents** (for adults)
* fill and sign the form before proceeding

👉 this step is **mandatory** for tatkal applications.

# 2️⃣ self-kiosk (token generation)

next, go to the **self kiosk machine**:

* enter your **file number / details**
* confirm your information

this step **enables token generation**.

⚠️ **without using the self-kiosk, your token will not be generated**, even if you have an appointment.

only after this will you be called for **counter a**.

# documents i carried

* old passport (original + self-attested copies of first &amp; last pages including ecr page)
* aadhaar (address proof)
* pan (identity)
* 10th marks card (ecnr proof)
* appointment receipt

*(i uploaded documents via digilocker but still carried originals and photocopies)*

# counter-wise experience

* **counter a:** biometrics + basic document scanning
* **counter b:** document verification
   * 10th marks card verified for ecnr
* **counter c / ap counter:** final approval

no medical certificate was asked, even though the portal showed it at some stage.

# status updates (same day)

status changed to:

&gt;police verification has been initiated on post pv basis and action for passport printing is initiated, to be followed by lamination, signing, quality check and dispatch.

this means:

* passport printing **starts immediately**
* police verification happens **after passport delivery**

# 🔔 update 1 – passport delivered

got my **passport delivered the very next day post 1 pm** via speed post.  
everything was smooth and fast.



# 👮 update 2 – police verification (banaswadi police station)

i visited **banaswadi police station** for police verification.

# documents the officer asked for:

* **aadhaar**
* **old passport**
* **electricity bill**
* **gas receipt**
* **one passport-size photo**

# what they actually checked:

* **original aadhaar**
* **original old passport**

📌 **important:**  
he **did not ask for any money at all**. no fees, no “chai-pani”, nothing.

the verification was straightforward and took just a few minutes.

# key takeaways

* 10th marks card is sufficient for **ecnr**
* pan is **not dob proof**, but it’s fine for re-issue if dob isn’t changing
* tatkal flow is smooth if documents are correct
* **tatkal counter + self-kiosk are mandatory before counter a**
* carry only **one self-attested copy per document**

# final outcome

* ✅ tatkal approved
* ✅ ecnr granted
* ✅ passport printing initiated same day

hope this helps someone who’s anxious or confused before their appointment.  
happy to answer questions in the comments."
reddit,2025-12-24 14:28:42,"colive sucks!! it’s shocking how a corporate can stoop so low , colive management is not picking calls while the electricity supplies and water supplies are cut. surprised at the audacity of the management to go against the law and still threaten the residents to be evicted ruthlessly. promises were not kept ,ridiculously  charged for services like cctv camera charges , beauty creams , diwali hampers what not and no deposit refunds given.

colive - get out of bengaluru city! u r ruining the city’s image. owners of the properties please sanction colive don’t tie up with them they will abuse owners as well as the working tenants. people are forced to take offs from their work due to electricity situation."
reddit,2025-12-24 19:02:52,"india is fucked up india is so fucked up 

why the fuck we dont protest? 

our politicians are very uneducated and corrupt except few and educated civil servants are always at threat by them. every person's goal is now to become rich and leave india 

air pollution, low wages, low civic sense, tax waivering most people don't pay taxes and people who do are also not given any benefits like roads infrastructure clean water/ air electricity, vip culture as we saw in messi event even if u get hit by rich kid's porsche nothing happens 

diabetes capital rape capital least on happiness index highest power very low per capita income very shitty civics infrastructure and civic servants 

i can name thousands of more problems and it can be solved china solved aqi problem and usa and other european countries are also very good about this type of issues 

anyone wanna protest if 1m people protest at once then government gonna shit there pants 

also biggest thing is religion caste sect and now language based riots

heard that news where a african guy teaches indian kids football for 12 years was given ultimatum to learn hindi or leave india by lawda politicians fuck i am so angry 

wanna protest should we make a plan or sthm????"
reddit,2025-12-24 22:35:42,"lucknow just doesn’t feel the same anymore i don’t know if it’s just me, but lucknow honestly doesn’t feel like the city it used to be.

the traffic is terrible now. e-rickshaws everywhere, stopping randomly, cutting lanes, no sense of order. constant honking, chaos on almost every road. earlier, the city had a calm charm,slow, graceful, pleasant to move around. that vibe is slowly disappearing.

what bothers me most is the complete lack of traffic discipline. no rules being followed,people driving from any side, wrong lanes, sudden turns, zero enforcement. it feels unmanaged.

i genuinely miss the old lucknow,the ambience, the dignity, the ease of life. growth is important, yes, but not at the cost of basic order and civic sense.

i’ve always been a bjp supporter, and honestly, things felt better when they first came into power. there was visible improvement and control. but right now? it just feels pathetic. development without planning isn’t real development.

lucknow deserves better management,especially when it comes to traffic and e-rickshaws otherwise, we’re losing(to some extent i believe we already lost)

what made this city special in the first place"
reddit,2025-12-25 15:28:16,"rahul gandhi and the truth people refuse to accept look at what is happening in this country right now. ed raids are everywhere. central agencies are being used like personal weapons by the bjp government. anyone who openly speaks against bjp ends up detained, booked, or sitting in jail for months or years without conviction, without trial, and often without solid proof. sonam wangchuk. arvind kejriwal. and many others. this is not random. this is a clear pattern.

if you are not in bjp and you become a real political threat, cases suddenly appear. either you get harassed, jailed, or pressured into joining bjp. we have seen this play out repeatedly. denying it is just being dishonest.

now ask yourself one simple question. if rahul gandhi was actually corrupt, if he had serious scams behind him, do you honestly believe bjp would leave him alone? this is the same government that uses ed and cbi against students, activists, journalists, and opposition chief ministers. but somehow rahul gandhi, who directly challenges them nationwide, is still not in jail. why? because they cannot touch him legally.

and please stop with this lazy nonsense that he is bjp’s biggest asset. cut that crap. everyone knows he hurts bjp politically. the bharat jodo yatra changed the narrative on the ground. his vote chori claims may not be fully accepted by everyone, but they planted doubt in people’s minds. even a little doubt is dangerous for a party in power. bjp knows that very well.

if even a small amount of solid proof existed, rahul gandhi would have been locked up long ago. just like others who dared to speak against the government. the fact that he is not says everything.

you can dislike him. you can disagree with his politics. but pretending this means nothing is pure intellectual dishonesty. rahul gandhi has to be clean, truthful, and honest to the core. otherwise the bjp would have destroyed him by now."
reddit,2025-12-26 15:13:32,"join us for a convention on the delhi air pollution and the climate crisis! smog has besieged our city. aqi is reaching new highs everyday. our lungs and eyes are burning, our throats are sore and our heads are bursting from pain. the very air that we breathe has turned poisonous. the water that we drink is killing us. pollution has become the biggest killer in our city - with 1 in 7 delhi residents dying because of pollution. the people of delhi are screaming in agony and the government sits mum, refusing to take any actions that might ruffle the feathers of the capitalists who are polluting our city and are leading the world on the road of climate catastrophe in their blind run for profit.

scientists for society has been campaigning against this pollution crisis and the larger climate crisis that has led us to this critical juncture - from protests to cycle rallies to discussions. citizens across delhi have also been coming out to demonstrate against the fatally rising pollution. but symbolic protests are not enough, and our struggle against pollution and the climate crisis cannot afford to be directionless and without orientation for a moment more.

to orient our struggle and to move towards a solution of the climate crisis, we must seriously study the climate crisis - investigate the root causes behind it as well as the approaches to solve it. in this direction, scientists for society is organizing a convention on climate crisis on 28 december at surjeet bhawan in delhi.

with this convention we call upon all scientists, professors, intellectuals, scholars, students and activists to join us, because at this critical juncture, as a carrier of the very knowledge which drives this entire society, it becomes our responsibility not to remain silent spectators while a profit-driven system pushes humanity toward environmental collapse. scientific knowledge must not be confined to laboratories and classrooms alone, it must be brought into the public sphere to get to the root cause of this problem and uncover the solutions that this profit-centric system cannot. we must use our knowledge to let the people know that it's not a natural disaster but a capital made disaster, which can be cured if treated in time. it is the duty of the scientific community to stand with the people, to speak truthfully, and to actively participate in building a collective resistance against this unfolding catastrophe.

join us, along with scientists, intellectuals, students and activists, in investigating the climate crisis and looking for a way out of it!
